"My husband and I stayed at the Best Western Parkway Center Inn for a U2 Concert at Heinz Field. We realized that the room was going to be extremely small based on the reviews, but I think I was taken aback as to how small it really was. The hotel was clean on both the inside and outside. Although our room was down a very narrow corridor and a joining room to another room, it was clean and updated with a nice flat screen TV. We had Bath n Body Works products, which I use at home. The best part of the hotel was the free shuttle to and from the concert. I hate having to drive in traffic and parking would have cost us a pretty penny. The staff are wonderful! Very friendly and accommodating.  Apparently there is free breakfast from 6am-9am, which we were told about, but didn't get to take advantage of since we overslept. There is also a pool which we missed because we weren't at the hotel long enough. We did get to take advantage of the free wii fi which was very nice. The purpose of our stay was a place to sleep and for this purpose, this hotel served us well. However, if you intend on staying an extended amount of the time at the hotel, I would suggest elsewhere. The quaint room made me feel very claustrophobic. As well, there aren't any places to eat near. I would stay there again for a reason of a place to crash after a concert or something similar. I wouldn't recommend staying with a family at this facility because of it's size, unless you can get a bigger room or a couple rooms at once.",1,1,Neutral,2,Positive
"Decent neighborhood pizza can be found in morningside at eddies pizza haus. The sauce and cheese are perfect, but the crust falls short.  It has a nice texture and overall the pizza isn't greasy, but the crust lacks much flavor. Maybe a little more salt is needed in the dough to compensate? The pizza is decent enough though and merits a try, perhaps it was an off day for Eddies.",1,1,Neutral,2,Positive

"I am updating my review of the Oakmont store after my last experience consigning there. The store employee happily accepted all of my items- until the next day when I received a call that the owner rejected half of the items. This was the third time I consigned with Ambiance in Oakmont, and I only offered items that I thought were in excellent condition from high end retailers; even though I have seen brands in the store from Charter Club for example (Ambiance says they do not accept them in the consigning agreement). The employee was very apologetic and she said that she stood by her assessment that the items were of good quality, but the owner (who she seemed upset with) disagreed. So, get your stuff together Ambiance owner and either train your employees better, or only accept items yourself so that you do not inconvenience potential customers like me. Surprisingly, I did not receive the same return on this set of consigned items; not sure if that is coincidence or not.",0,0,Negative,0,Negative
"Great place to go if you need grease and carbs to soak up all of the drinking you've been doing!  Many a late night was spent eating grilled cheese with tomato on rye and fries, and only a few nights in the parking lot hanging onto the light pole for dear life while hurling up that last stoli v and ginger!

"There are always atleast 2 group of annoying kids who just loiter and stare at everyone as they're walking in & out. The staff doesn't seem to care. Make sure to check your fries before you leave bc they are sometimes Luke warm. Even after you buy something it's a challenge for them to unlock the bathroom. You stand at the door 5min, walk to the counter and ask again then walk back and wait at the door forever again until finally you head back to the counter one last time and freak out.. all to pop a squat over the toilet.

"We went to the Mad Mex in Cranberry Twp and won't make the mistake of going back. \n\nThe food was horribly hot, like they just toss in heat for heat's sake, rather than for taste. I ordered the mole chicken enchiladas and that was NOT any kind of mole I've ever had. The sauce was more like a weak, thin ranchero sauce and both the sauce and the chicken was too hot. Even the guacamole was too hot. \n\nI recognize this restaurant chain is trying to be a trendy \""fusion\"" of Tex-Mex and CA, but they failed. Luckily, they are in the same parking lot as a pharmacy so I was able to walk straight over for some Tums.\n\nIf you want GOOD Tex-Mex, go to El Campo in Monaca or El Paso Mexican Grill in Chippewa. Both restaurants are excellent examples of good Tex-Mex, similar to the styles typically served in Central California.",0,0,Negative,0,Negative
"I'm writing this review to give you a heads up before you see this Doctor. The office staff and administration are very unprofessional. I left a message with multiple people regarding my bill, and no one ever called me back. I had to hound them to get an answer about my bill. \n\nSecond, and most important, make sure your insurance is going to cover Dr. Goldberg's visits and blood work. He recommended to me that I get a physical, and he knew I was a student because I told him. I got the physical done. Later, I found out my health insurance doesn't pay for preventative visits. I received an $800.00 bill for the blood work. I can't pay for my bill because I'm a student and don't have any cash flow at this current time. I can't believe the Doctor wouldn't give me a heads up to make sure my insurance would cover work that wasn't necessary and was strictly preventative. The office can't do anything to help me cover the bill. In addition, the office staff said the onus is on me to make sure my insurance covers visits. Frustrating situation!",0,0,Negative,0,Negative
"Almost but not quite perfect. Cain's is a well-priced smoke free 1/2 bar 1/2 sports restaurant hybrid. The front has tall tables and chairs (like bar stool height) and the back has booths and 6 flatscreen TV's. The whole place was redone in 2009 when a new owner bought it, who bought Redbeards in Mt. Washington and totally redid it. The chef is from Grand View, a fantastic actual restaurant, not bar restaurant. So you're basically getting, at normal bar food prices, truly excellent bar food. Seems like the truly scuzzy clientele that someone 3 years ago mentioned have been evaporated to cheaper Dormont bars. The patrons here are more of the youngish (under 40) Mt. Lebanon variety.\n\nThe vegetable wrap is phenomenal, the burgers are great, and the \""Codfather\"" gigantic fish sandwich is simply amazing, the best outside of Wholey's. The \""Codfather\"" is prepared 3 ways - \""Part 1\"" is tartar, lettuce tomato, \""Part 2\"" is coleslaw, fries and hot sauce and I forget what \""Part 3\"" is. The onion rings are beer battered (not breaded) and fried to perfection. They taste moderately of beer, the true hallmark of excellent rings. The food you're getting here isn't pushing any envelopes but it absolutely is the best bar food in Pittsburgh. Apparently they have a $5 \""express lunch\"" that includes a 1/2 sandwich and soup or salad. Never had it but that's extremely cheap.\n\nBeer is fairly priced; Sam Adams and Blue Moon are $3.50 while Yuengling, Coors & Miller are about $2.50, $2 on special. Everything else is under $5.50.\n\nWing night Wednesdays the good: 25 cent wing night. Best wings I've had in the 'burgh. Wing night the bad: they charge 50 cents per ranch or blue cheese dressing, effectively making 10 wings (the minimum order, which they DON'T disclose) $3 rather than $2.50 which makes it more like 30 cent wing night. Nor do they include celery/carrots, as they do on the menu for regular wing orders. This is the first Wednesday (wing night) they've done this upcharge. I don't mind 30 cent wings, I just like honesty up front. They also don't let you take the wings home that you don't finish. Sorry, but I want two flavors and don't want to weigh 300 pounds so I'm only gonna eat 12-14 wings. We threw away at least a dozen between the 2 of us. People go hungry in this city every night and that's a crime.\n\nThe mild buffalo wings are more like medium buffalo wings and are excellent, as are the orange ginger wings. The bbq and honey bbq are what you'd expect. The jalapeno cheddar is fake nacho cheese and pickled jalapenos on top - NOT what we expected and not what we'd get again but still very good.\n\nService is good 4/5 times. It's slower with wing night; only 2 servers for the whole place.\n\nDefinitely go here for the Codfather and the veggie wrap. Get onion rings as your side. Oh! And get a salad too; they use spring mix and baby spinach and make almost all of their dressings.",2,2,Positive,2,Positive

"I only went here to have a few drinks, and talk with a friend who wasn't sure if he wanted to eat or not. We were escorted to a table and were cool, the waitress was friendly and tentative since our conversation was rollin'. Long story short we were there for 5 hours, just drinking, and if our waitress could of re-worded her words, our experience wouldn't have been so sour. She came over and stated \""I'm leaving here is the check, if you would like to stay you're more then welcome to order from the bar.\"" So we continued to talk not thinking anything of it, or someone was going to pick up her tip. WELL not two minutes later she comes back to us and says \"" IM LEAVING, I need you to pay your check.\"" At this point me being me, gets a little annoyed, as my friend is looking at me like no she didn't! So he paid as a gentlemen do, and we continued the night, as they dimmed the lights and shut off the music we got the hint we've been talking way to long. If she could have been a tid more polite, it would have been a good experience. The atmosphere was great, the food looked good, but your sour mouth ruined it all.",0,0,Negative,0,Negative
"\""Filthy\"" isn't a strong enough term. Try \""infested.\""  NEVER, EVER AGAIN. No matter how much I adore Bell's Sicilian pizza (which I typically order to carry out), the filth of the place is overwhelming. Took my mother into the dining room Friday evening. We were promptly seated (table nearest the kitchen and the wait station, constant employee traffic) and given beverages and menus via the hostess, who promised our waitress would take care of us soon. For the next 20 minutes, no employee acknowledged our existence, although we quickly placed our closed menus at the edge of the table to signal our readiness to order. As the minutes ticked away, I tried not to look at the foul carpeting, which appears to have been last cleaned approximately never. A cook emerged from the kitchen and quite literally shouted over our heads to a waitress at the far end of the nearly-filled dining room because he couldn't read her writing. (Have these people never eaten in a restaurant themselves??) Even still, we waited... until I absently flicked at one of the dozens of dark spots on the wall above our booth. It flew away. INSECTS ALL OVER THE WALL. If that's how the front is maintained, what must the kitchen look like??? We reopened the menu, found beverage prices and left money on the table. There was no indication that any of the waitresses or the hostess even noticed. DISGUSTING AND INEXCUSABLE. The place needs to be shut down and fumigated. Are they afraid they'd lose money if they closed long enough to CLEAN? Do they pay anyone to clean anything? I'll never go back.",0,0,Negative,0,Negative

"I like the look of this Coffee Tree Roasters location more than anything else.  If you like people watching on a nice day, try grabbing a seat near the front of the shop, when they open up the huge glass windows.  In the winter, the coveted seating is towards the back of the shop, the couches and chairs by the fireplace.  The meeting room in the back is handy, but I've found it to be really chilly in the winter--not sure how it is in other seasons.\n\nThe coffee's all right, and I feel \""meh\"" about the hot chocolate and chai.  While the baked goods in the case look tempting, I haven't been wowed.  One person I went with got a biscotti, which was rock hard--now, biscotti's supposed to be crispy, but not that hard.

In all honesty, we haven't been back for a year though we kept saying \"" we have to get to Pinos!\"" Needless to say, we were disappointed.  The place has changed and not for the better.  It seems in an effort to create a quaint wine bar, Pinos lost sight of the original draw and that was the food.  The menu has been scaled back considerably.  Though the food was adequate, it's not the same.  I came here because the food was amazing and with that no longer being the case, I doubt we will return.  Hopefully, things will change back to how they were.  Customer advice for what it's worth.  Refocus on great italian food not a wine bar concept.

"Well this visit started off good. I was seated right away, no wait. Was given a good beer selection of some PA Craft beers. Ordered the traditional deep dish pizza, but with no onions. Now after we ordered, it just went downhill from there. Was never asked if I wanted another beer, the waitress just gave me more water. My pizza still had onions in it. Which I stated right off the bat, that I didn't blame the girl who took my order. I know cooks can't read. I was one for many years. Mistakes happen, and the manger took care of it and took the item off my bill. NO complaints, still ate the food and it was good. Just not a fan of onions on my pizza. \n\nNow onto the bill, the server continues to tell me that she was sorry for the mistake and declares she told the cooks not to add onions. I already said it was taking care of and there's no worries. She goes on to say that the next day was her birthday, and if I felt like leaving all my money as a tip, it wouldn't go unnoticed. I took this as a joke as I had told her earlier I worked in the industry. When I hand over the gift card I had on hand, she comes back and again repeats herself, tells me that cash as a tip is preferred as she doesn't have to claim it at the end of the night. And again if I felt like leaving her all my money, she would just be so freaking happy. Let me explain one thing and hopefully I am very clear on it. No server, and I mean NO server anywhere, should ever ask a guest or customer for a tip, yet alone, do it twice! So out of kindness, which I shouldn't have left anything by this point. I left a nice tip for the cost of what food I did  have to pay for.\n\nBottom line, the food was good for the price, but the service from this one person as I don't know how the rest of the servers are.

"The Partner In Cuisine (PIC) and I had an early dinner there recently thanks to Groupon and we were not disappointed.  Since we weren't sure what to get and were just generically hungry, we decided to just let the menu decide for us and we ordered one of each of the highlighted items on the menu - the \""house specials\"" according to our server.\n\nThe calamari was excellent and it was apparent that it had been hand breaded.  The Asian fusion made for a delicious alternative to the typical calamari that was reminiscent of a General Tso's squid.  The main dishes were also good, but nothing in particular stuck out about them.  I also had a red-velved martini which I thought was probably the best part of the meal.\n\nOverall, I would definitely go back on a weeknight for happy hour or on a Tuesday to try the variety of mini martinis, but I think I'll leave paying $9 for an alcoholic beverage to \""special\"" nights and not just a typical weekend dinner.\n\nThey do lose a star because even though we were one of three occupied tables and a few taken seats at the bar, the service was incredibly slow.  It took so long for our appetizer to come out, I began to question whether the cook had to get in his car and go down to Wholey's to buy more squid.",2,2,Positive,2,Positive
"Rollier's is exactly everything that I can remember about the local hardware store when I was growing up. I'm certain that they have someone named \""Chuck\"" that knows the answer to any of your household projects. This place has a wide variety of items that you can use to complete most of your home projects but it is not all encompassing. \n\nFor the most part their prices are right on point maybe a little on the high side but I figure that since most of the people there can find someone who can give you some real advice on your home project it is worth the slight mark-up. Although I have been mostly satisfied with Rollier's I have had a number of less than desirable experiences ranging from rudeness to being outright ripped off. Example I was sold a sink faucet spray hose that was not new, matter of fact it was so used that there was calcium deposits on it. The sink hose adapter didn't fit my sink so I had to run over to Lowe's to buy the correct fit. When I attempted to return it Rollier's accused me of using it! What I just bought this, how the heck could calcium deposits develop in under a week. And then the store manager had the nerve to ask me why I waited a week to return the faucet. Dude I travel for my job I was out of town for 4 nights. I have been back a few times since but I have hard feelings every time I bust out some cash for a purchase.\n\nAfter writing this review I think I will go to Lowe's again and just fumble through projects with advice from someone who knows little about home improvement projects.

"If you like sandwiches with french fries piled on them, go for it.   But no good sandwich needs nonsense like that.

"I took a subaru outback here for the annual state safety and emissions inspections.  First I was charged more for this service than what was clearly posted on the service station wall.  Secondly I was failed for a lug nut that had rusted to the point that the technicians could not get it off.   I was quoted $425 for them to get it off.  I was able to accomplish this with a $6 bottle of penetrating oil and a breaker bar.  \n\nWhen I returned to have the reinspection I was charged for it (their policy posted on the service wall clearly states you get a second inspection within 30 days of initially failing free of charge).  This time they were able to get the lug nut off but supposedly could not get it back on.  This was odd as I had taken it off and put it back on numerous times to ensure it was okay to pass.  They once again quoted me $425, stating they would have to replace the wheel stud.  The new wheel stud cost me $3.50 at the local parts store and I did the job in under an hour without a single power tool.  \n\nThis shop is not following the guidelines they have clearly posted on their wall and are fabricating problems in an effort to overcharge you for simple repairs.

"In the Wesin Hotel, attached to the David Lawrence Convention Center - this is probably the highest priced, over saturated fried fish establishment that exists in downtown Pittsburgh.\n\nNow, they call themselves the \""Orginal\"" fish market - but don't let that fool you. This place is an overpriced clone of legal seafood - with a good but overpriced service bar. Seriously.... $26 for two MGD beers and a double Bailey's on the rocks? Oy. Something tells me they want to loose business, rather than keep it. The wine selection is kinda dated, and I don't know the last time they cleaned the wine taps - but it looks to me like something I'd rather avoid- or have the bottle delivered to my table to avoid cross contamination.\n\nThe food, while basicially good (fried seafood) everything - is way overpriced to me. And there is no really good way to put this, but if you're looking for Fish and Chips - cross the street and go the the nearby Tonic restaurant. The portion size and the service are much better.\n\nStill, if you've got an expense account, and don't want to walk out of the convention hotel - yes, this will work for almost anyone.

"We have been coming here since it opened, but will not go back after our three last visits. It has gone downhill badly. Three visits ago we were seated in the trolley and then completely ignored for 30 minutes. There was a waitress, but apparently she was new and only had the front half. I finally went out front and demanded the manager who finally assigned a waitress for us and comp'ed our meals. The lasagna was very disappointing with hard noodles and definitely not oven baked and barely warm.\nTwo visits ago to use the gift cards we intended to use on the previous visit, service was poor and food was fair.\nThe last visit last night was the third strike and SW is OUT! Very poor service and food. The drinks were all ice and refills were not timely. The server past our table many times, but she flew by each time like we were not there. The zucchini appetizer was good. We only got one loaf of bread which was barely done and came with almost no butter. No ranch dressing...really! This is the Strip District after all with many stores for crying out loud. The food was very poor. The spaghetti and meatballs had about a tablespoon of sauce. The fetticini alfredo was almost devoid of sauce, as well. My Wild Mushroom and Chicken was not warm but tasted okay. We will NOT be going back.

"First impression upon entering the store (2/5) : \""What the heck is that smell?!\"" After walking into the store a little further, I found my answer. CHEESE! The store was a little on the \""sloppy/pack rat/ sweaty/ definitely wouldn't hurt to mop every once in a while\"" side. My first instinct wasn't to leave so that is always a good thing. \n\nCustomer service (5/5): I went there because my husband randomly missed Spain so he wanted to make a bunch of mini bocadillos with different types of meat and cheeses. We already got the meat from another place down the street so what better place to get a variety of cheeses than the Macaroni co? The lady that helped us was wonderful!! She was so patient with us even though there were a million people waiting in line.  She automatically knew which cheese to recommend based on what would compliment the meat that we had. She was extremely knowledgeable about the various kinds of cheese. I could seriously listen to her talk all day about the history of the cheese... she made it so interesting.  My husband is VERY indecisive so he couldn't figure out which one he liked more. \n\nFood (4/5): We tried at least 7 different kinds of cheese and I didn't like any of them... definitely not a cheese person. My husband on the other hand, LOVED every single one of them! We also went there for some Rustic Italian or any hard shelled bread. I know this is not the store's fault be there needs to be a sign that says, \""Do NOT touch the actual bread unless you are buying it!!!\"" I saw at least 3 people who were squeezing the bread with their dirty hands to see if it was soft. Totally grossed me out. Why would anyone think that is okay?!?! I can understand if you are squeezing the bread through the bag but don't TOUCH it! That is only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

"So...I was sold on MCN Salon about a year ago, and found it through Yelp reviews.  I really was sold at one point.  It's clean.  It's up-scale.  It's hip.  It's pretty.\nBut after my last haircut, I'm going to suck it up, and make the 45 minute drive back to my old stylist in Peters Township.\nBasically - I just feel like they're trying to up-sell you the entire time on products and more services.  For example, if I wanted my eyebrows colored, I probably would have added that to my appointment.\nTheir stylists are GREAT, don't get me wrong, but I just don't feel like I'm being pampered or focused on when I'm there.  The last time, my stylist was working on 3 different people while I was getting a cut and color.  Therefore, that left junior stylists to wash and dry my hair.  The time before that, the stylist was working on 2 different people.  I have no problem with that - I just don't know who to tip at the end because I feel like my main stylist, actually did very little in the long run.  \nPlus - I told my stylist on our very first visit - \""I don't want to think about my hair.  YOU are the STYLIST!  YOU are the DESIGNER!  Every time I come in here, I will want a different hair cut, but I want YOU to do it.  You will NEVER hear me say, 'just trim it up and do like we did last time'.  So please, I trust you to just make me look HOT.\""\nWell - the whole past year that I have gone there, I have sadly just been given the same haircut all 4 times.  I HATE THAT!  I'm not a hair stylist.  I know most people are stuck in their old ways and never like to change their hair; however, I am not.  I LOVE getting new hair cuts.  I love going from long to short...or from short to growing it out.  I like change - especially with the seasons!  Give me some edge!  Make me look sexy!   (I never feel this way leaving this salon).\nPlus, every time I have gone for a cut and color, I feel like it has gotten more expensive every single time.  I don't know what I'm being charged for...but my first session was a little under $120.  This past time it was up to $175 and like I said, I only go for a cut and color.  So I don't understand why my appointment is $55 more than it was 6 weeks before (and 6 weeks before I actually bought PRODUCT!).\nAfter 4 sessions, I can now say that I'll CANT WAIT to be going back to Stephan Szabo's in Peters!

"I am normally a Bar Louie Fan - my husband and I LOVE the one in Tampa.  This location needs a lot of work.  We went on a Friday evening before a show at the Improv.  We were looking to meet up with friends and have drinks and a quick bite to eat.  We never got to the food part because of the level of service that we received.  We got there at about 6:40/6:45 so Happy Hour was wrapping up, but I would say that the bar was not even 3/4 full.  There were also plenty of empty tables.  This should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction.  But we grabbed a table.  I am not a clock watcher, so I am not sure how long it took us to get a server but it was at least 5-7 minutes.  Then we got our drinks at 7:04.  The only reason that I know is because I was looking at my phone because my husband and I wanted to get some apps ordered before the end of Happy Hour.  That went out the window.  When our friends for there; they ordered drinks.  We finished them and left.  The server was nice, that is not the issue.  The issue was how GROSSLY UNDERSTAFFED they were.  They had two bartenders on (I think) and not nearly enough cocktail servers.  The server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with \""this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped\"".  That is a sign that you need more staff.  I have never had this happen at any other bar before.  Get more staff.  We ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time, not the fact that we did not get HH pricing.  Even though, in my opinion, they should have honored HH pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:50/7:55.  We ended up going to the Improv and got food there.

"I had a free entree from Big Burrito for my birthday, for which we decided to use at Casbah a few weeks ago.

I tasted a bit of everything and really enjoyed the kale. I like really really creamy risotto, and this wasn't quite there. I dont want to say it was undercooked, as I like I just like mine over-cooked.\n- Fried Apple Empanadas (vanilla bean cider reduction, toasted oat streusel,  \ncaramel ice cream) The ice cream was great, but the empanadas were bland to me.\n\nService: Not terrible. I understand at nice restaurants people enjoy taking their time to relax, enjoy their meals, and converse with their dinner-mates, but our server should have been more observant to the fact that we would be just sitting there with empty places waiting for the desert menu.

"Despite living in PIttsburgh for most of my life, I've somehow managed to never eat at Max's Allegheny Tavern until recently.  \n\nMy initial impression of the restaurant was positive - the place had an old neighborhood feel to it, a small crowd was drinking at the end of the antique hardwood bar, and the German murals on the walls made me crave an icy-cold German lager with a stout head of foam.  I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.\n\nAnd I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a \""what's going on here\"" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.\n\nFinally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.\n\nMy first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: \""Uh-oh\"".  The menu is huge with a number of \""slow-food\"" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.\n\nI ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  \n\nSadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.\n\nMy sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \""bacon\"" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \""meat\"".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \n\nMax's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \""The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\"".\n\nThat's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.\n\nIf you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.  \n\nI'll never return.",0,1,Neutral,0,Negative
"I love the concept but I think it is overrated.  I have been hearing so much hype about Primanti Brothers that I was so excited to finally get to stop in at one.  I have no problem with the size or amount of grease, I just don't get the greatness of the sandwiches.\n\nWe ordered the Kolbassi & Cheese and the Pitts-burger cheesesteak (#2 best seller).  I had half of each one along with cheese fries.  I thought both sandwiches were a little dry especially the cheesesteak.  The coleslaw seemed to be too dry for my taste or maybe it was the abundance of fries that dried everything out for me.  I am not a big fry fan in the first place.  I would like to see some other options for bread like a wheat or whole grain option.  I would also recommend putting extra cheese on the sandwich as I couldn't even taste cheese.  I like cheese and they need more to help balance the dryness.\n\nService was a little lame as I barely could understand our \""too cool\"" server.  He seemed disinterested in us for the most part.  The pregnant waitress who helped us out once seemed more congenial and helpful.  I like the fact that it is small and fast.  I just don't get the vast appeal.  I need sauces, fresh ingredients, whole grains, and cheese.  I would recommend for everyone to try the place once but I bet there is better options in the Burg.",1,0,Negative,0,Negative

My husband and I had the pleasure of dining at Lidia's on Thanksgiving day.  The food was good.  No Butterball turkey here!  Staff is friendly and we were seated right away.

The ambiance is lovely and the tables weren't close together.,2,2,Positive,2,Positive
"Food was good, very average and just a bunch of rolls - nigiri and sashimi are kinda an afterthought. I wish the menu identified the ingredients. Instead I had to ask the server (really nice lady, but definitely not quick and efficient - service was soooo slow) who kindly explained each one. I ended up choosing two and they were good, more like meh good. Since I'm from SoCal, I definitely wouldn't go here when I'm back in Pittsburgh again and would try to find another sushi joint.",0,0,Negative,0,Negative
"Crap!  I can't believe that I missed a \""First to Review\"" by just a matter of weeks.  Max's Allegheny Tavern has been a shining star and a \""must\"" for my Pittsburgh rotation of places to visit.  Years ago, when I worked on the Northside for Heinz, I spent many a rowdy Friday night here in the basement with factory workers.  \n\nWhat's there to say?  It's a Northside institution and always has a mixed crowd that is super cool and friendly.  The bartenders are friendly and manage to remember my name and drink choice even though I'm here only a few times a year.  My Friday nights here must have made quite an impression!  I love the decor here, dark wood paneling with lots of stained glass, and the downstairs bar is where the naughty people hang.  Jukebox and room for dancing.  The food is very homey and very reasonably priced.  The German nachos are always worth ordering, and they are smothered with Gouda cheese.  The spatzle is also a creamy indulgent treat.  And for those seeking the real Deutsch culinary experience, they have a large variety of sausages and schnitzels.  So it's a sausage factory in more ways than one.",2,2,Positive,2,Positive

"Saturday afternoon.... and not a soul in this place? \n\nWe stopped in only to grab a Bloody Mary. The bartender was sort of in love with herself and claimed that she made THE BEST Bloody Mary ever! Well, it was actually  good but it was certainly not the best ever. I am not sure why people insist on talking themselves up all of the time. \n\nThey had a menu but I only glanced at it as I'm sure the food would have left a lot to be desired. Especially after reading some less-than-stellar Yelp reviews. \n\nBut okay, decent Bloody Mary... it could have used some garnishes like celery or olives to be better.

san francisco california visitor liked the food and the local is great. I am thinking about relocating to pttsbrgh area.

"I've been here twice. The first time was at least two years ago and I can't remember anything in particular about it.\n\nThe second time, though, was tonight, Valentine's Day. A group  of friends and I chose this restaurant after the place we wanted to go was closed--for good. Roland's was it, then. It wasn't very crowded, so we were seated right away. The first thing that caught my attention was how the waitresses/waiters were dressed. They weren't dressed how I would have expected them to be. They were in jeans and baggy tshirts. But, our waitress was helpful, and our food came out pretty quickly. it wasn't a memorable meal or experience. I wanted a caesar salad with my dinner, but they were out of romaine lettuce (and it wasn't late in the evening--maybe 6:30pm at the latest). The bleu cheese dressing, though, tasted pretty good. I ordered a ravioli dish for my entree, but when I asked if I could get a different sauce, the waitress said it's already mixed together, meh. I'm not a fan of that. When my friends went to order their pasta dishes, they had a choice between penne and linguini, but the restaurant was out of penne, too.\n\nOh well, the prices aren't terrible, and the good came out pretty quickly, and hot. It's not the best restaurant, but it's not a stink hole, either.",0,0,Negative,2,Positive
"I decided to try this place after reading on Yelp how good it is.  This is no Mike and Tony's or big greek gyro in Market square.  I won't be back.  They only take cash. The workers are not Greek chefs and are very condescending.   The gyro sandwich for $5 was OK at best.  They threw some tomatoes on it. The sauce could be better.  The fries for $2.50 were undercooked.  I asked for ketchup and was told to find a table with a bottle.  We are talking a plain bottle with mystery ketchup. It was definitely not Heinz which is a sin in Pittsburgh!   I had to hunt silverware and straws.  You would think they would give them to you with the meal.  \n\nThey charge about $2 for a drink with no free refills.  They put a sign that said refills are 50 cents and if you take one without paying you are stealing and subject to prosecution.  You can also get a drink from their cooler for $1.  They are no-name juices or water like you might find in a dollar store for 25 cents or less.  \n\nTables were not very clean.  I was surprised at the number of patrons.  This place is definitely regularly visited. They have daily specials, but the #1 item on my list is quality and taste of food.  They get a C from me.",0,0,Negative,0,Negative
"PIzza Parma's decent tasting mega-big-2ft-long hot sausage hoagie was let down by the piss poor attitude of the staff, the lack of cleanliness of the tables and floor, the out-of-order red door restroom, the bright yellow for no-explicable reason walls. \n\nThe large color-striped 80's retro tables and green chairs have come back in style but this win is purely accidental and achieved only by laziness and lack of renovation.\n\nThat is all.",1,0,Negative,0,Negative

Everyone comments on the absurdity of the bathroom and rightfully so. It is a complete dungeon.\n\nAs for people saying it is in a sketchy area of town, I just gotta say \""M is for melodrama\"".

"Penn Mac is a fun shopping experience. I used to do a lot of my weekly shopping here, but now that I live in the North Hills I've got that can't-cross-the-river syndrome and I only get there every other week or so. It's miles above a Market District, though, in terms of entertainment value and pricing.\n\nThe cheese counter is pretty good. It's not the most amazing selection ever, but it's great for Pittsburgh. For example, they don't carry a variety of aged cheddars or Stiltons, opting instead to offer one or two basic and many flavored versions (with apples, with onions, etc.) They do let you sample, which I recommend; like another reviewer, I've gotten over-old blue cheese here once or twice. They've always enforced the half-pound minimum for me. The fresh mozzarella is great, and I can't resist it when tomatoes are in season. I hate to even mention it, but one time I got home and found... well, a hair in my mozzarella. It put me off for a few weeks but seems to have been a one-time incident (and no, I never brought it up to them).\n\nThe deli has fantastic prices and does proper thin slices, nicely laid out on paper sheets so it doesn't stick together. Daniele prosciutto is amazing, and the domestic is pretty good at a great price. Iberico and Serrano jamon? Yes please.\n\nService at both the cheese and deli counters can take a pretty long time if you go on a weekend. However, I've been able to walk right up on weekday afternoons, and the weekend logjam is kind of fun once in a while.\n\nIn the same room they have the amazing olive bar. I pretty much only buy olives in the Strip. I know the Iggle has an olive bar, but everything I've ever bought from one tastes off in a way I can't put my finger on. Castleventrano olives (a bright, clear light green) are amazing: buttery and briny and fruity with a firm texture. Cerignola are good, and the various stuffed olives on offer are nice if you don't feel like dealing with pits.\n\nI haven't really bought many of their bulk goods aside from Jordan almonds, to which I am shamelessly addicted. They have a variety of pretty colors, as well as the \""seconds\"" which aren't as shiny but taste great anyway.\n\nI love the selection of anchovies, tuna and tomato products in the dry goods area. They also have a good variety of hot sauces, though I can't say I've ever seen Pickapeppa there. Full range (I think) of Dave's Insanity, and lots of other brands as well. Important: They do sell Blennd concentrate, which you can also pick up at the Iggle. I have fond childhood memories of drinking Blennd at the KMart cafeteria growing up. I introduced my Michigan-born husband to it and he never visits Pittsburgh without getting Blennd at least once. (You can also get it premixed and cold at Wholey's, FYI.)\n\nIn the next room you'll find baccala (yum), pour-your-own olive oils at a reasonable price (not a huge selection, but the Spanish is fruity and a good everyday sort of thing at $4.99/12oz). I pretty much never buy bread here, opting to hit up the double rustic baguettes at Mancini's instead. The anise love knot cookies are great.\n\nThe last room has produce, normally at a good price but not the best selection. They do have fresh figs in season, thank God. I have to admit I've never tried the fresh pasta, since that's one of those things I just make at home. I should probably remedy that so I can offer an opinion on it. They sometimes have refrigerated and ready-to-go San Pelligrino Chinotto, a bitter soda that comes in a pretty bottle you can use as a small vase afterwards.\n\nCheckout is straightforward and efficient, but you will be in line for a while if you go on a weekend. It's nuts, just like everywhere else in the Strip. If you can, visit all the shops both on a weekday and on a weekend to enjoy two totally different experiences.\n\nThey do have a small parking area behind the store on Liberty, with which I wish you good luck on a Saturday. Otherwise it's street parking, but there's a ton of that, and walking past and through the other shops in the Strip is so much fun it shouldn't matter anyway.",2,2,Positive,2,Positive
"Any place where I can crack up, cut up, let my hair down and be loose is a place I love to be. It's a diner , kinda of self explanatory seeing as to how that's part of the name.  So they have your typical dinner fare, breakfast items, sandwichs CHICKEN TENDERS.  You get it, I don't need to explain a diner to you. \n\n\n Don't judge me I'm usually wasted upon arrival to Tom's Diner it's not a place where I plan on ending up just a place that I manage to get lol.\n\nAnyhow the pancakes are good and the wait staff is down to earth and very tolerant. \nIn my opinion it's not worth a trip across town, but with friends in Dormont it's a sure stop if I'm visiting over that way. \n\nEnjoy!",2,2,Positive,2,Positive
"After looking at the hotel online I was excited, the pictures looked new and very nice. I was in town attending a conference at the convention center so along with how great everything looked, you couldn't beat the location. \n\nHowever, I had the absolute worst hotel experience at the Pittsburgh Westin. I am a Starwood Preferred Guest member and up until now have had great experiences, but this one was so bad it really makes me question the integrity of the brand and I am hesitant to stay at another Starwood establishment. \n\nEven tonight as I try to log into my SPG to see if my points for being \""conservative\"" with the room were updated, I can't logon to the site as \""The system is temporarily unavailable.\"" I should also note I have photographs of everything, because I couldn't believe how bad the stay was. \n\n1. The terrible experience happened before I even arrived. When I googled the hotel, accusations of bed bugs appeared on both Yelp.com and Bedbegregistry.com - and the hotel had yet to take the time to respond. A simple detail that if someone was paying attention they would be able to resolve. \n\n2. I arrived at the hotel after a 7+ hour drive only to find out that the bathroom in my hotel room was broken. After two calls to Guest Services, about 30 minutes later a maintenance man came by, and it took him about 15 minutes to fix it. So a total of 45 minutes before I could use the rest room after arriving. I had suggested to Guest Services on the second call that they move me to a new room and it was awkwardly laughed off. \n\n3. After using the restroom (finally!) I noticed the tub was dirty and there was mold on the top of the shower by the rod and on top and inside the mini-fridge. The mold was \""new\"" so it could have easily been wiped off and taken care of if the room was being properly clean and attention to detail was paid. The fact that the hotel lacked the ability for such simple house keeping was surprising. \n\n4. The paint in various places of the room was chipping and some of the furniture, most notably the side table were knicked and scratched badly. \n\n5. Because of the bed bug reviews, I stripped the sheets to look for evidence. I did not find any, but did become aware of many brown and black tar stains on the sheets that were tucked in to the mattress. \n\n6. I begrudgingly ordered room service because of how late it was by the time I got settled. I ordered the Turkey BLT with lemon aioli and arugula salad. Instead I got cold, what-seemed-like-day-old deli meat, burnt bacon with a thin, thin layer of mayo, not aioli. The arugula salad did not have 1 piece of arugula - it was mixed greens with shredded carrots instead. When you read the description and look at what I actually received, it is very, very disappointing. \n\n7. The coffee pot in my room leaked all off, wetting the sugar, napkins, etc. \n\n8. They charged the wrong credit card after both myself and my office manager telling several different people which card to charge. I had booked the room on a corporate card, and my office manager had believed she straightened everything out at the front desk that they were to charge the card on file because I would not have the corporate card with me. The first thing I was asked by the front desk was for a credit card. After I explained the situation to the front desk, they insisted that the card on file would be charged and they just needed my card for \""incidentals\"" - after back and fourth I gave in and gave them my card, assured it would not be charged. Then when I checked out two days later, I once again confirmed that they would charge the card on file and they still charged the wrong one.  Fast forward to the following week when I notice the charges, I called the billing department and someone has still yet to return my call. I am being charged interest on this card for their mistake. \n\nThis was an absolute terrible experience and I am very disappointed at the Westin and Starwood Hotels for their obvious lack of pride and detail with this hotel.",0,0,Negative,0,Negative
"We were visiting from out of town and just spent 6 hours driving. Found this place, read reviews on Yelp which were OK, and decided to ordered two slices. Hum...sorry not slices. More like two squares of cheesy bread. When we said these aren't slices, the lady at the register looked confused as though pizzas always look like that. We obviously aren't locals by the way we were dressed so the lady (who talked terribly) should have notified us when we first ordered it! They also have pictures of real pizzas on the wall -_-\nIt also took a really long time to cook those little things because they weren't pizzas. Since I was so hungry, i ordered another square of unhappiness and it was handed to me in the cooking wrapper not a paper plate, ugh.

"Legends of the North Shore on the top 25 restaurants in Pittsburgh list? I would have to disagree. I joined a three dining companions for dinner on a recent Friday night. When I walked in, I was shocked by how incredibly tiny it is inside. We were crammed at a table next to a large party. Our server was very matter of fact and to the point. What I would expect eating at a dinner, not a nice Italian restaurant. I decided to order the Penne Vodka with prosciutto and the wedding soup. The soup was nothing memorable. I enjoyed the crisp bread (foccacia) and oil better. When the entree's arrived, I was surprised that my Penne vodka was garnished with prosciutto. I assumed from the menu that there would be more proscuitto than a thin two inch slice on top of the dish. Overall, the sauce was very good. Not too creamy, not to tomatoey. However, I enjoyed my husband's gnocchi bolognese much more. The gnocchi was tender and the sauce was flavorful and meaty. All in all, I doubt I will be heading back to Legends. With so many great restaurants in Pittsburgh, Legends doesn't make my list.",1,0,Negative,0,Negative
"Descriptive phrase: classic Greek.\n\nChristos is unassuming, but good. Katie K., her sister, and I were wandering around downtown Pittsburgh on a Sunday night and many other things were closed. We stopped briefly to look at the menu that was laid on a table outside, and a nice old man came right out and invited us in. So we followed him.\n\nIt's a cramped little space, made even more so by the insane amount of Greek relics/touristy items everywhere. Even on a Sunday night, though, the place had a good and varied crowd ranging from teens to families to old men hanging around.\n\nOur waiter, who I found out later was the owner, was odd in a fantastic way. He just was bright and quick, and obviously loved his lot in life.\n\nWe started with the Hummus ($4) which came with fresh, hot pita bread. The bread was great, but I didn't enjoy the hummus (too bland). We each had a glass of the house wine (red and white) (~$3?) which were delicious. I ordered the Lamb Kebab ($12.95) which came with some grilled veggies and rice pilaf on the plate but also included a soup/salad. I loved the soup. LOVED it. It was a milky broth with rice. Sounds odd, but perfect for me as I was getting over a cold, and went well with the pita bread from before. The grilled veggies were good, and I really liked the rice pilaf. The lamb kebab was not bad, but Katie K's was so tough she didn't eat much of it. I did not have the same problem, though we'd order the chicken next time.\n\nWe finished the night with Baklava ($3) and the famous Onassis Dessert ($3). The owner regaled the entire place with the story of how he worked on the Jackie O yacht for years and this was her favorite dessert. Goodness, I can understand why. It looks like a simple slice of vanilla cake but it's so much more, with a honey syrup and whipped cream with cinnamon. I want it. I want it now.\n\nOverall, it was a 3-star kind of place. Good but not great. The dessert and wine were top notch, but it lost points on the main entree and the price (which I thought would be reasonable but topped out at $25 a person with tip!). Christos' saving grace is its ambience and staff. Check it out if you have the time.",1,1,Neutral,2,Positive

"Being new to the city, I went into panic about finding a new hair stylist. SF and Boston have plenty of reviews to choose from but Pittsburgh didn't have many, let alone stellar reviews on salons. At the time I colored my hair so I didn't want to let just anyone put foils and scissors near my head. Finding a new hairstylist is like a game of russian roulette to me. I can either be safe or be really screwed for a few weeks.\n\nMCN was really the only salon ranked high in a search in my neighborhood so I gambled and scheduled an appointment with Sara. The salon is located near a Whole Foods, Starbucks, Walgreens and what use to be a Borders. It is clean, spacious and open with nice views overlooking the city.\n\nSara did a great job and continues to do so (I'm loyal like that). She consults me first and doesn't deviate from what we agree upon. Her demeanor is professional and friendly. While I was waiting for my color to process, MCN has some outlets for you to plug in your computer to pass the time.\n\nReasonably priced and another nice thing is that MCN occasionally will give free goodies as a thank you or for the holidays. While certainly the do is most important, the little things count as well. I will say though that they do seem a little pushy with product and the product may not even be the best one for your hair. I know salons can make a great profit off of product from the show Tabitha's Salon but this can ruin your experience at MCN after an awesome haircut/color treatment.",2,0,Negative,2,Positive

"I can't believe this place has not been reviewed yet.  If you live in beechview you already know about this place, but if you don't you need to try this place out if you are passing through.\n\nAt first glance, you will barely notice the bar/restaurant from the exterior.  Inside it is your typical Pittsburgh bar with a some additional seating in the back.  So you would think, why take the time to review this place.  Well they have a old-fashion popcorn machine which they offer free while you are drinking at the bar and this popcorn was phenomenal.  But it only gets better, happy hour pints for 90 cents.  So, delicious popcorn + beer= Great afternoon after work.  Well at this point, I was like wow, this little place well served its purpose for a cheap happy hour on my way home from work. \n\nAnd then: The Reuben.

I had the eggplant dish, which was hot, fresh and tasty, but what disappointed me was the lack of requested spice (level 9).  When I ask for something to be spicy, make it spicy.

"Pita Land has the best pitas in the city, hands down.\n\nThey also have amazing spinach pies and pepperoni rolls - well, technically, they are not pepperoni rolls, but pita pepperoni rolls.

Once I finish that jar, I am coming here to buy my tahini.\n\nThey also sell gyro sandwiches for $5 on Saturdays. I haven't brought one, but I sampled one and it tasted good.",2,2,Positive,2,Positive
This was my second time eating at Roland's  seafood Grill the first time I had a great experience the food was excellent the service was great even though they were busy we got really good service and everything was really fresh and good this time the food was needless to say very poorly prepared the service what service we got seemed more interested and everybody but the six people setting at our table. It took a couple of tries to get refills on drinks I asked for a cup of water I didn't even get the cup of water the pasta was more like wedding soup my medium stake was almost completely pink all the way through very undercooked my nieces pasta had more onions in it then it had sauce I will never visit this place again!!! It wasn't that busy tonight but we stood there for almost 15 minutes waiting for them to get us a table. I spoke with the manager and explained my concerns to him I just can't see me spending that kind of money for the experience that I had tonight again.,0,0,Negative,0,Negative

"terrible... terrible terrible terrible... funny, the food there reminded me of the end of Goodfellas where the guy ordered pasta in a restaurant and got watery noodles and ketchup... yeah, not too far off the mark here. \n\nlet me back up a bit first.... My stepson and I were on our own for dinner so made sense to go out for the evening. So I picked this place knowing it was a kid friendly joint and not chili's or fuddruckers etc. The building itself is great. I loved the feeling of going into this renovated looking warehouse. He thought it was cool as well. The best part was inside. the decor is fantastic, and really the only reason to go. Loads of vintage signs and things and smack in the middle of the one dining room - a real vintage trolly car - completely renovated... of course I asked for us to be seated inside there... that was really neat. \n\nThen the food came... I had spaghetti and Meatballs and a Caesar salad. Now, the salad was really flavorful and fresh. Normally I hate salads in places like this. the lettuce tastes old and rubbery... not in this case. it was excellent. The spaghetti on the other hand - wow, watery, slightly overcooked noodles and sauce I bet was straight out of a Hunt's Spaghetti sauce can. the meatballs were frozen and reheated - i hate that off taste frozen meat takes on. so the salad got an A and spaghetti was a bit loser. \n\nMy stepson ordered the Italian wedding soup - he loved it - I did not try it... he also got the same watery noodles with the mushroom red sauce. Those mushrooms must have come straight from a can. they were button and the one I tasted had that tinned flavor.... so essentially this restaurant depends completely on frozen, processed, canned ingredients rather than fresh and flavorful. \n\nBottom line... have kids with you? they will love it... just the adults? find something... anything else... it is going to disappoint.",0,0,Negative,0,Negative

The parking is atrocious, with only probably only 75 spots for a pretty popular store.  And have fun just getting into the parking lot from Centre.  Okay, I'm going to a negative place right now....\n\nI stop in here one a whim when I'm out in the area if I'm really craving sushi, because it's way better than the Giant Eagle's sushi down the street.  It's still not he best fast sushi (Giant Eagle Waterfront), but it does the job.  Again, they're almost $3 more than at GE.  When I run in to grab sushi and usually ad Odwalla by bill comes to almost $20!

"I honestly can't get enough of this place.  We used to come here after going to Pirates games since its right up the road.

The atmosphere has a nice feel to it, perhaps its the antiquity.. I love the cuckoo clock and tapestries they have.\n\nNow, to the food:\nThe bread they give you... with apple butter!! ... is very fresh and tasty.  Try not to fill up on it while waiting on your huge main course.. The Bavarian soft pretzels were warm and soft when we ordered them.  Also delicious.\n\nThe sampler platter is a great deal if you don't know yet what you like.  You get 3 entrees and the typical sides for ~$16.

"I wasn't expecting 4 star service. We walked in and had to wait 5 minutes before one of the servers noticed us since the hostess wasn't at her post. He took us to the banquet room and seated us at the last table in the front. The tables had plastic table cloths that have seen better days ours had holes in it and still had some caked on super stain sauce in one area. Then we waited 20 minutes before our waitress came to greet us. She took our drink order and our dinner order. (pretty simple since it was a prix fix menu with only choices for soup or salad and a choice of ham or turkey and either Apple or Pumpkin Pie). She brought the drinks right away. Then 10 minutes for the salad/soup -- very tasty, but no rolls were delivered to go with and no sign of the waitress. One of the employees goes out the emergency exit door located directly behind me (BLAST OF COLD AIR) Only after finishing the first course did she bring the rolls/butter and didn't clear the dirty plates. Another 15 minutes passed before the waitress stopped by the table and cleared the dirty dishes. (THE HOSTESS COMES IN FROM OUTSIDE THROUGH THE DOOR WITH A BLAST OF COLD AIR) A minute later she came by and said our main course would be along in a minute and she proceeded to go out the door directly behind me. (MORE COLD AIR) The main course was delivered by a food runner. The turkey was tasty and just a little on the dry side and needed more gravy, but there was no sign of our waitress to even ask for more gravy. Eating as slowly as possible so as to have the opportunity to get gravy for the turkey there simply was no attention paid to us. (ANOTHER EMPLOYEE GOES THROUGH THE DOOR, MORE COLD AIR) Finally the waitress comes over and asks how was it, I explain that the cold air is too much to handle. THE EMPLOYEE WHO WENT OUT CAME BACK IN AND WE ALL GET BLASTED BY COLD AIR. She replies it is what it is and shrugs and walks away. She must have said something to the manager, because he comes over to ask how our meal was. I reply that it was just OK, that the food was good for the most part (he gave a shocked reply because I didn't say it was great) but that I was disturbed with the number of times the employees kept using the door to go outside to smoke. He seemed shocked to learn that that door was being used at all and said he'd put a stop to it. We said that we usually tip 100% on holiday meals like this since the workers have to give up a day with their family but that since the staff didn't seem to care as much about us, so we would not be doing 100% tip this time. I explained that we don't expect any kind of comp, but that he needed to know that his employees were making the dining room uncomfortable by using the emergency exit for their smoke breaks and social encounters. He said he was sorry for our experience and left the table. Our waitress eventually stopped by and we requested our pie packed to go. She delivered the pie and the bill at the same time. -- it isn't over yet. . . .  While in the process of signing the bill the hostess comes over to request the chairs at our table. I explain to her that we are leaving. She was very impatient and said she only needed a minute to take the chairs and I scolded her saying that we are leaving right away and to give us 30 seconds to sign the check and she can have all the chairs at our table she scuffed off to take chairs from an empty table and blocked our attempt to exit while she was struggling to move the chair she grabbed. We chose to exit through the main dining room and bar as should be the practice for all patrons and employees. Like I said to the manager, we consider ourselves to be fairly regular patrons of Atria's PNC Park, and Atria's Fox Chapel -- but this was the worst service I've ever for an Atria's Restaurant. I don't want anything for publishing this review other than people to be highly aware of the lack of common sense by the staff on this particular day. I'll eat at Atria's again but it will be with some trepidation and with high caution that they'll probably screw something up so I have to be on high alert to get what I pay for. Posting this on Facebook and to yelp and tripadvisor might help get the owner's attention. The place could be great if they just had proper training, rules and regulations for their staff and a dose of common sense.",0,0,Negative,0,Negative
"Living in Bloomfield, I was excited to finally try some authentic, excellent Italian fare. Unfortunately, I hadn't had much luck so far at Pleasure Bar (okay food), or D'Amico's (awful food). I've had more consistent, tasty Italian at the Olive Garden, which is sad. So I decided to give Alexander's Italian Bistro a try.\n\nWe stopped in tonight, a Saturday evening. The place was pretty much full and we didn't have a reservation, but we got seated after just a few minutes. The tables are packed pretty tight and you can see the servers dancing around each other precariously. The decor is charming without being all tacky like other local Italian places...I love the beautiful backlit stained glass panels that open the space up. There is a nice little bar area in the front with a smaller bar food menu and a couple nice TVs...we'll have to check that out soon.\n\nMr. got the Eggplant Alexander, I got the Mafalda Alexander. The eggplant was nice and crispy, not mushy inside like eggplant parmesan can often turn out. It was very rich and definitely two meals worth of food. My pasta was excellent. The noodles were flavorful on their own, and cooked freshly and perfectly. I like the mafalda noodles, which aren't too commonly used in most Italian places. The sauce, a mixture of marinara and alfredo, was tasty and not overpowering. The spicy Italian sausage was soooo good...just the right amount of spicy, tender and flavorful. They give a pretty large basket of bread that is moist, fresh, and flaky.\n\nWe got the tiramisu for dessert, which was pretty good. It's hard to find real tiramisu anyways so I give them credit for having it. The ladyfingers were a little bit tough to cut with a spoon but they were good, and the cream was very good, not too sweet. A nice finish to the meal.\n\nOnly downsides...no soup or salad included with the dish, those are extra. Our server was nice enough but kinda disappeared when we were finished with our food...we waited around a good 15 minutes for her to come back and wrap Mr.'s leftovers and ask if we wanted dessert, then another 10 minutes after finishing dessert for her to come back with the check. This is one of my top pet peeves.\n\nAlexander himself (I'm pretty sure anyway...) stopped by the table at the end of our meal to ask how everything was, which is always a nice touch in my book. Everyone working there seemed like they must be family, but not the type of family who dread working for the family business, which is nice.\n\nWe'll definitely be back.",2,1,Neutral,2,Positive
"We stopped at Papa J's last Friday night (8/1) for a round of drinks. There were 7 of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening.  One member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall, as it was fairly busy that night. In the short time that he was there, a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. He then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. She said \""yep\"" and then abruptly turned and walked away. At that point, he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. When my friend told him of what had occurred, the manager said \""What do you want me to do\""?\n\nMy friend said \""An apology would be a good start\"" whereupon the manager looked back at him and said \""Get out and don't come back\"" ???????? Are you kidding????\n\nMy friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants. He was not screaming or belligerent in any way, shape, or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred. \n\nThat being said, we left and went back to 131 East, where we had previously eaten. The service there was fabulous, as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite.\n\nThere are new restaurants that have opened in Carnegie as of late. Papa J's is no longer the only game in town.  Obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management. Appalling!!

"We decided to stop by Olive or Twist on a recent Saturday night before a show. A friend was at a wedding upstairs and asked us to drop in to say hi. Apparently they host wedding receptions in the lounge area above the bar/restaurant.\n I was hoping to get a quick meal and a drink before the show. When we arrived the bar was packed and we were told that they had no availability to sit in the restaurant section. But, little can deter me. I scoped out the tables by the bar and noticed a couple getting ready to pay. After making casual chit chat, they agreed to save their table for us. They paid and left while we ordered a drink at the bar. As soon as they got up the waitress put a reserved sign on the table, I assumed it was for us and sat down. Nope. She was trying to reserve it for an 8pm reservation. I thought this was the bar area which is seat yourself? Oh well, I told her we had to be out by 8 for a show anyway so it would work out fine. A few minutes later she came back and told us no, that won't work and we will have to find a place at the bar. Seriously? We are already sitting in the seat yourself tables, it was fine 2 minutes ago, we have to leave by 8, what's the issue? Rather annoyed we looked for seats and ways to inch ourselves into the already overly crowded bar when the waitress returned and said she will reserve another table that was leaving. Now, we have wasted 10 minutes of our already limited time before the show so, I asked what was the fastest thing on the menu. We ordered soup, salad and the buffalo chicken spread. The soup arrived first. I had the homemade chicken noodle. Warm, comfort food that hit the spot. Next was the pear salad with candied walnuts, blue cheese and strawberry vinagerette.  Again, super tasty. I could snack on the candied walnuts all day. Then the buffalo chicken spread. Presentation was great-in a martini glass. The pita chips were delic! But where was the chicken? I searched through the entire martini glass, not one shred or chunk of chicken. Being a buffalo chicken dip lover, I was sorely disappointed. As for the drinks, stick with the martinis as the wine was also a big disappointment.",1,0,Negative,0,Negative
"My husband and I visited on a quiet Friday afternoon, and we were politely greeted by the bartender. We each ordered a beer and were promptly served. After taking a moment to glance over the menu, we decided on the pita pizza app, the special (beer battered fish/Mac and cheese) and the fish tacos. \nThe pita pizza: a soft pita shell with pesto, tomatoes, chicken and cheese. BORING. \nThis appetizer reminded me of my mother's Irish cooking: tasteless. A simple addition of caramelized onions would have solved this problem. \nEntree 1: Beer battered fish and Mac and cheese. Ruling: BLAND. My husband ordered this one and described the fish as \""wet\"" and the Mac and cheese as \""play-doh\"". They also served the dish with lettuce, tomato and onion, as if it were a sandwich. \nEntree 2: Fish tacos. Ruling: OVERCOOKED/COVER-UP ATTEMPTED. Ok, so they weren't bad, but the fish was dry. Covered with tomatoes and a bit of lettuce, the tacos were, again, on the tasteless side. The attempt at adding flavor came with the chipotle mayo and sour cream. \nThese only helped to moisten the fish. The corn relish was masked by jalape\u00f1o peppers and the rice came shaped as if out of a small flowerpot.\nThe service was quite friendly, so, no fault there.

"So apparently I have this habit, at least last week, of visiting a bar/restaurant during its most dead time.

"This place is defiantly a historic site! From the floor to the table tops to the bathrooms! I love learning about the history of how places came about. Mary the bartender gave me lots of info.......oldest bar, 1st one to let women in, same flooring, etc. \n\nThe food is frozen so if you're looking for fresh seafood this ain't it! I had one of their famous oysters.  Very good I highly recommend getting only 3 very filling. I had the special crab cakes & 2 sides. Imitation crab & lots of filling. So I don't need to tell you how nasty that was. My house made chips were good & cole slaw had very little flavor. \n\nI did notice-after I ordered-everyone was getting the fish sandwich.

"As a lifelong Pittsburgher, I've been to Tambellini's enough times over the years -- and I think it's still open simply because of it's location practically next door to the Benedum, and patrons who go there aren't the regular theater-goers.  I was invited to go with friends, who were old enough to remember when it was probably good.\nThe prices are *outrageously* high for the quality of the food and portions.  I had the Chicken Marsala, which was alright, but something I normally eat served out of a chafing dish at a funeral buffet. This was comparable to a catered version and the restaurant itself deserves a funeral... It's outdated and just a factory for getting people in and out and on time to the cultural events they're going to.\nThe waitress was nice enough, seemed a bit embarrassed to respond 'no' when I asked if certain menu items were fresh.  On the other hand, she disappeared quite a bit and didn't ask if we wanted any desserts -- which we probably would've if we'd been asked.\nEven though Downtown after business hours isn't the most exciting place to eat, there are other places I'll insist on going instead of back to Tambellini's.",0,1,Neutral,0,Negative
"Had dinner at Papa J's with a group of 6.  I loved how the restaurant is in a old brick building with large windows. It felt like a neighborhood restaurant. On a Saturday night, the restaurant was full but not crowded.  We were seated in a room with poor acoustics.  It was difficult to hear people at our table and the waitress.  While she tried, I can see the asperation in her face when she had to repeat the specials to both sides of the table.\n\nPeople ordered bourbon on the rocks before dinner which seemed watered down, while my lemon drop was made nice.  The bread was delicious!  Can you describe it to be creamy?  The fried zucchini was lightly breaded and not too oily.  It was a large portion made up of 2 sliced zucchinis.\n\nWe ordered a variety of dishes.  The pasta dish was dry with more pasta than sauce or meat.  Those who ordered the fish special thought it was delicious.  The shrimp dish was enjoyed as well.  I had the chicken marsala which was pretty good.  The marsala sauce wasn't too thick, and the chicken moist.\n\nHard to tell if the deserts were \""homemade.\""  The tiramisu and spumoni were small in portion and meant for one. \n\nOn the whole, I was on the fence with my overall impression of Papa J's.  \""A-ok\"" probably is the best way to describe it.",1,0,Negative,2,Positive

It's \""Seat Yourself\"", but there were no signs stating this, so we stood there looking like fools for a minute.

She came back with our drinks, dropped them off, and left again. We didn't see her for another 20 minutes. Ultimately, we were there for 30 minutes before she took our order. This was aggravating to me. I don't mind waiting for my food if I know it's going to be awesome and they're making it with love, but come on now.

His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich.  We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away.  The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!

"Have taken my car here a few times because there's a bus stop out front so it's convenient to drop my car off and get to work. But after what happened I will never be back. They just cost me money and lost my tires. \n\nIn March I blew a tire on a pothole (naturally) and they replaced the two front tires for me. The second tire was fine but you have to replace both, I kept it so that I would have a spare if another one blew out. Put the tires in my basement, no problem. Saved for a rainy day. \n\nThis week I ran over a nail and the tire wasn't fixable so I had to get it replaced. Luckily I've got a spare! I called Monro early this morning to see if I could get in but they said it would be tomorrow at the earliest. I needed my car so I took it to pep boys (three hour turnaround - also the last time I needed an oil change they said they were booked for three days, good lord). \n\nI drop the car off at Pep Boys and tell them the extra tire is in the back. They call me up and tell me the tire is the wrong size. What? Monro gave me the wrong tires back when they replaced them in March. So I had to buy a new tire when I had a perfectly good one that is now god knows where. The tire was the wrong size and definitely didn't come from my car as it wouldn't have fit on the rim. \n\nAfter paying for the tire at Pep Boys I went over to Monro to see what they would do about it. They informed me that because I already had the new tire put on they couldn't do anything but the next time I came in they \""would work with me\"". Why the hell would I come back when you just screwed me out of a hundred bucks and a good tire? Not worth chancing. Because you couldn't fit me in within a day I get screwed? \n\nIf you need tires go to Pep Boys on Milvalle.

It's always an option on a Saturday afternoon when we're thinking of someplace to go to have an early dinner, late lunch or just grab a sammie and some beer. And it's a 30 minute drive for me! The service has always been good and we've never had an issue. We love the sandwiches and the wraps - my fave is the jalapeno steak wrap, although lately it seems that they've had too much wrap and not enough steak. But it IS real steak, not Steak-ums. That isn't always the case at other places.\n\nBut you can't go wrong - the Lot 17 salad is killer good. And the Jerk Chicken sandwich with the grilled pineapple is my wife's favorite. Not to mention the amazing sweet potato fries and the crack-like brown sugar butter dipping sauce. Always a good rotating selection of good beers and I'm always happy to choose among several I would drink anytime.

"Being a huge Bastianich fan, I was stoked to finally dine at Lidia's Pittsburgh.  Entering the restaurant, you automatically feel impressed.  It's spacious yet feels warm, inviting, and comfortable.  There are beautiful touches and accents everywhere and the designer was not afraid to use color, tastefully.  I was ready to feast!\n\nI ordered the polipo (grilled octopus) which was tender and flavorful thanks to the zesty vinaigrette.  My osso bucco (braised pork shank) on a bed of barley risotto was easily the tastiest thing I ate that night being succulent, flavorful and utterly tender.  That's not to demean my companion's hearty and tasty mushroom soup or his grilled salmon which was prepared quite nicely.   I ordered the budino di nutella (nutella pudding) for dessert.  It looked better on the menu unfortunately.  It was bit too heavy and rich.  Did I really say that?  Lesson learned...perhaps.  Probably not.\n\nService is top notch.  We never waited and our food came out promptly.  Prices are extremely reasonable given the quality and copious portions they serve.  In fact, I think I went up a full pant size upon leaving.

It's been a good six months since my last visit, I remember what I ordered and how good the entire experience was.\n\nI ordered the eggplant with garlic sauce and an order of bok choy which was steamed first, then quickly stir fried, delicious. The eggplant was tender, a touch of heat from chilis, garlicky, meaty and filling, served with brown rice, very nutritious. My family all ordered something different, Judy, my cousin who thinks China Gate is the finest Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh, and would come here at the drop of a hat, ordered her Chicken and Green Beans. I must admit, when I did eat meat, I've had this on many occasions and it's really very good.

Eh.\n\nWith Andy's Special, there was a variety of rolls, and made with a continuous strip of seawood (ie inside on one roll, outside on the next), which I actually found annoying, as the rolls fell apart when trying to separate them.

"I ate at this restaurant last night with three dining companions.  We decided to sit in the bar area at a high table which had views of the ample number of TV's.  The beer list that they had was nice with about 20 different beers on tap and a nice selection of bottles.  I ended up having the Philly Shackamaximum with my waitress telling me that she preferred the Long Trails Porter.  It was served in a chilled glass and tasted pretty good to me.\n\nFor dinner we attempted to start off by ordering the Blues BBQ Pork Nachos.  We were told that they did not have any pork and so we were not able to order it.  At this point we were also told that they did not have any veggie burgers as well.  So we started out with the Chicken Chili Nachos.  They were pretty good and were covered with real cheese as opposed to nacho cheese which was to my liking.  For dinner I decided on having the Lovely Lisa's Salad since I love both blue cheese and granny smith apples.  Upon receiving the salad I dug in.  The chicken was cooked nicely, moist and tender, and there was a nice coating of blue cheese on the salad.  However there was a problem since there were no granny smith apples on the salad.  Whenever the waitress came back to check on us I asked about the missing apples.  She went to the kitchen and came back and told us that they were out of them and promptly left.  I am not normally one to complain but I feel like something could have been substituted in for the apples, or that I should have been told before ordering or they could have discounted the salad but none of that occurred.  It is sad that it happened too because the rest of my salad was pretty good but that left the proverbial bitter taste in my mouth.\n\nThe bottom line is that I have been here before and the food is generally good.   However, leaving a major part off an item and being told that the kitchen is out without any rectification will make me think twice before returning here again.  It is a shame because Buffalo Blues does have potential.",0,0,Negative,0,Negative

"Why waste time? Want a sandwich, fries and slaw? Put it all in one, this is what Primati Bro's  does. \n\nEvery sandwich here is huge, not really due to the protein, but due to the handful(s) of fried and slaw and the thick bread each one is built with. I opted for the Colossal fish and cheese sandwich (6.99).  The fish had a nice crisp batter, the fires were a bit soggy , the bread was nice and soft and the slaw was decent.  Alone I loved the fish, All together the starch of the bread and fried over power the fish. There was hot sauce at the table to help add flavor (frank's red hot style). \n\nSeating is odd, seat your self and you will get service when you are noticed. Drink come in to go cups and the menu is on paper for you to keep as notice to you doctor of your  1000+ calorie meal. \n\nMy coworker also got the cheese fires for extra cholesterol and to max his per diem.

"When my boyfriend and I were down with the flu, we ordered some food here through Eat24. I got a chicken noodle soup and he got the seafood calzone. When I unpacked the food and tried a sip of my soup, I found that it was cold and had bubbles in it, as if there was soap in it. I couldn't really taste anything, but my boyfriend said it smelled like dishwater. To say the least, I was disappointed in my soup. When my boyfriend cut into his calzone, he said the cheese was barely melted. We thought it was undercooked and touched the outside. It was cold, as if it was sitting out in the open for a long time. He tried to take a bite, but the dough was barely even cooked and the contents of the seafood calzone was cold and tasted sour.\nThis was our first time ordering from here and it was such a sad experience to have, since our food was inedible.

We spiced everything at. 7/10. It had a bite, but wasn't too hot. \n\nErythema was freshly made. There were only two other families in the restaurant when we were there, both Indian/Pakistani? \n\nService was slow and grumpy. But it was totally worth it. It's hard to find good Indian food in Pittsburgh. Udipi is ok for pure veg... Corriander is greasy...

"What a cool place! I have NO green thumb WHATSOEVER, but had passed by for about a year now since I moved to Dormont and had always thought the shop looked cute. Now was my chance as I needed a last minute Christmas present for my grandma. \n\nThe place is larger than you think from the outside. They actually have a whole outdoor area that's covered for the winter with many different plants I couldn't identify. I thought the owner was super duper sweet and just really energetic. Her and another staff member helped me pick out a plant that was in a vase, not in a pot, and looked really cool and modern. I loved it and had a fleeting thought to pick one up myself... if I wouldn't kill it (which I probably would!). \n\nI had commented about a table full of vases filled with what looked like works of art. They turned out to be flower displays for hotels, but man where they cool. If I was doing an event or having a wedding, that's exactly what I would have wanted. They just looked really modern but creative. \n\nThey also have some winged friends you can say hi to, including one screaming one in the back that you can't see. Kinda creepy, but I guess that comes with a unique shop! I will absolutely be back to pick up items for people and consider them for any events I have coming up.",2,2,Positive,2,Positive

"Primanti Brothers is definitely a Pittsburgh institution. If you are traveling through, you definitely have stop here, at least for the novelty factor. Overall, food is good for a... well, for a sandwich shop... But in the end, I didn't leave with a sense that I really had to come back. \n\nThe real novelty at Primanti Brothers is that all of there sandwiches include french fries and cole slaw inside that sandwich. And to that I say... \""who cares\"".  I personally didn't care for the fries and slaw inside my sandwich, but I am also not a huge french fry or cole slaw fan. (I like the good ones, but I can easily pass on average,) I will say that their cole slaw, which was vinegar rather than mayonnaise based, was quite good. And there fries were above average, but not as good as somewhere like say, Five Guys. \n\nThe ingredients in the sandwich were all pretty good. I had the Pastrami and my friend had the Angus steak. The bread, meat, cheese, etc., were all good quality and were distinct when tasted individually. The sandwiches also seemed to work OK as a package, but for some reason for me--aside from the novelty factor--they didn't stand out. I think that maybe with the fries and slaw in there, there is just too much going on and those two tend to dominate the whole sandwich. It really takes over and you hardly taste the quality of the other ingredients. \n\nOn the plus side, the sandwiches average about $7 each, and for that price, your get a pretty decent sandwich. In the end, Primanti Brothers is a definite must try if you are passing through, but I don't see myself craving these babies any time soon.",0,0,Negative,2,Positive

"Short of getting on my hands and knees and begging the stylist to cut ONE HALF of an INCH, I don't know what else I could have done.. \n\nBefore every haircut I explain that I am very particular about the length of my hair -- I want to keep it long, it grows very slowly, that it is IMPERATIVE to only cut a TINY AMOUNT off, etc, etc. I made this extremely clear to the stylist. She promised that she \""wouldn't do anything crazy..\""\n\nLet's just say I am using this as a cathartic outlet for my experience because I went in for a trim but left with FOUR INCHES missing from my hair. I'm still recovering aesthetically and emotionally from this trauma! It just doesn't make sense to me why a stylist would do exactly the opposite of what was requested. I think maybe she is used to cutting children's hair and not listening to them.

"I'm sorry, this place is simply not good. Unfortunately, it is yet another example of poorly made Americanized Italian food. Too much cheese, too much butter and cream, and quite possibly the worst bread I have ever consumed at any Italian restaurant in my life. \n\nSomeone had to go out of their way to find bread this flavorless and awful. It's already a travesty that it's served to me before the meal, but to put it on my sandwich! I'm actually offended for Italians, and bread. Yes bread, this is not your best. The eggplant Parmesan served to my mother was soggy, covered with an absurd amount of plastic Parmesan cheese swimming in a bland sauce. My fathers pasta, cream and cheese. Contrary to popular believe, this is not traditional Italian! This is what some would refer to as, terrible and heavy. And the cannoli? Words could not describe my disappointment.\n\nI'll admit it, I'm already an Italian food snob. I cook tons of Italian food for myself, family, and friends, and I only use the highest quality ingredients and go about preparing my meals in traditional southern Italian ways. I've had phenomenal Italian meals at the few great Italian restaurants in this city, so whenever I get the opportunity to eat at another \""Italian\"" joint, I'm heading in with high expectations.\n\nIs this what Italian food in Pittsburgh has come too? Seeing other similar Italian places in Bloomfield, I'm sad to say...yes. I'm actually slightly upset even writing this because the waitstaff is charming, and I hear the owners are great, but to pass this off as representative of Italian food is an injustice. If you want a truly great Italian meal please look elsewhere.",0,0,Negative,0,Negative
"Last weekend my mother and I headed down to the strip to get some weekly goods - lunch meat and cheese from Penn Mac - veggies at Stans - needed some new spices from Penzeys for a chili I was going to make that day....we were both a little hungry and knew we wanted to have a snack before shopping.\n\nWe parked in front of Roland's and see the sign: Famous for Lobster Rolls and Bloody Mary's!\n\nPerfect. \n\nMy mother got the Lobster Roll, which she said was 'good'.

"Amazing brunch! I'd never been to Casbah before until this past Sunday when we decided to check it out for their prix-fixe menu.\n\nFor $22, you get your choice of alcoholic brunch beverage, an appetizer and an entree. An incredible price for a serious amount of great food. They had many options on their fixed menu - something for everyone. From huge waffles and omelets to lamb dishes, fish and the usual brunch regulars such as eggs benedict too. The appetizers list was equally as large. \n\nI started with a bloody mary. Was a nice middle ground between heavy and light - and it had some kick to it. Very good. For an appetizer I got the cheese and fruit plate with french baguette slices. There was a soft brie-like goat cheese, a blue cheese and a mild dry sheeps milk cheese as well. All were wonderful. For my entree I went with the Salmon Eggs Benedict. It was perfect. The fruit on the side was fresh cut, and the home fries were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.\n\nI tasted a couple of other things as well. Both the polenta and the mushroom soup on the appetizer list were great. Didn't try any of the other entrees, but everyone seemed pleased. The only complaint was from a friend that ordered the truffle omelet - and it was that he thought they went too heavy on truffle oil, drowning out the eggs. \n\nAlso, service was absolutely perfect. We had a tall waiter, forget his name, but he was one of the most professional servers I've ever had. The table was cleared and cleaned immediately...he was never pushy, always friendly, and had great suggestions.

"Meh. At best. So I went to Bado's tonight w/ my dad and sister and it was a bit lackluster. I started out with chicken noodle soup (w/ no noodles) and a very spicy bloody ( I know. I know.

Iceberg lettuce, croutons, cucumbers, and dry swordfish. Lame. My dad got a meatball casserole which is something I would have never ordered...meatballs and casserole aren't a selling point for me, let alone as a package deal.  This meatball casserole dish was just pasta and meatballs...thankfully for my dads heart. \n\nMy sister got a salad (again just iceberg lettuce, croutons, cucumbers) with chicken fingers.  She also split a small mushroom pizza with my dad which was above average. \n\nI guess pizza is what Bados is known for so you should just stick with that if you go.  \n\nPro: Spicy bloody marys, decent pizza, cute waiter, wide beer selection\nCon: bland salads, noodleless noodle soups, not many healthy options, no dinner entrees besides pasta,",0,0,Negative,0,Negative
"Having lived near this Atria's location in the past, I can say that I've spent more than my fair share of time at the PNC Park Atria's. My wife and I stopped in this past week, and for me, I was reminded of why I enjoy Atria's...but this having been our first time at Atria's together, and witnessing my wife's experience, I realized why the place could garner such low reviews.\n\nFor someone like myself, who's actually had enough positive and negative food experiences at Atria's to know exactly what to order and what to steer clear of, I can make the experience a positive one, but that's a situation I'm afforded now thanks to my previous patience and convenience. My wife, opting to stray from my suggestions had an awful dinner. Her plate of bland fish and asparagus left her turned off completely. Luckily, we were using a gift card, so it wasn't as frustrating for her as it could've been. Regardless, walking away from an entire plate of food is disheartening.\n\nThat led me to realize this: If you're only at Atria's once, you're odds aren't that great of having a good experience. That's just the reality of the situation. There are a handful of really good things on the menu that I LOVE. The parmesan crusted chicken is really good, although it can sometimes be a little too oily. The pot roast is excellent, but it's way too heavy for most of the year...ESPECIALLY during baseball season when they're busier. Their chili is really on-point...especially paired with their bread, and the salmon salad is excellent. Although, I don't like the salmon, so I swap the salmon for chicken for a great salad option. The carrot cake is insanely good, but truth be told, it's not homemade. I could care less, though, as it's still some of the best carrot cake I've ever eaten. Period. Other notable items are the pot roast nachos, crab cakes, red skin smashed potatoes, and the reuben.\n\nThat's really where the positives end, though. I've learned to steer clear of the burgers because of the inconsistency with which they're prepared. I've received more undercooked burgers at Atria's than any other restaurant, and it's just not worth the gamble anymore. My filets have always been perfectly-prepared, but the one time I got a strip it was practically burned on one side and undercooked on the other. Failing to cook burgers and steaks correctly isn't that surprising, but deciding to serve them to customers despite their incorrect preparation IS surprising...and poor.\n\nI know that the last time I had salmon on my salad, the fish tasted \""off\"" and I paid the price for it later. I've never given a single fish meal a chance there since (we're talking years now). Hence, my request for chicken on my salads now. Most of the meals that I've had are average, and I've practically tried the entirety of the menu over the years, so believe me when I say it.\n\nWhy do I continue to go? Well, because the few items that I do love, are crave-worthy, and having become a regular (less so, nowadays), the service that I received at the bar was always excellent. Daniel and Roy have always provided  great service to me, and good service goes the distance, as far I'm concerned, so it's been worth stopping in from time-to-time. Unfortunately, if I can't sit at the bar, I don't always stick around, as the service at the tables is really hit-or-miss. For every good server they have, they have two more that could care less about their jobs...especially during peak times.\n\nRegardless, this is my favorite Atria's location, because it's the least \""stuffy\"" and pretentious location of them all, but there's still a lot of room to improve...and I hope it does.",1,0,Negative,2,Positive
"I was home for the holidays and wanted to take some friends of mine climbing.  They've never belayed and don't have equipment so my hope was that we could go, I could test out of the belay class and we could top rope some easy climbs.\n\nDreams crushed.  Only people that are belay certified can even be in the top rope room.  I would've had to pay $5 to test out of the certification and even if my friends wanted to take a quick lesson on how to belay, its only at very specific times and you need to give advanced notice.\n\nSo we bouldered.  The walls are old, made of smooth plywood and though the walls are a good variety, you eventually end up right on top of one another.  You can only top out on one tiny section, everything else backs right up to another wall or and abyss.  With someone who isn't super comfortable down climbing or jumping from the top, I wasn't always super excited to fall when there wasn't a nice big cushion.  Those were only on the overhanging walls.\n\nThe place was super busy on a Sunday afternoon and group after group rolled in.

"Dueling piano bars in Pittsburgh started at Station Square, and they died out. Then when the chain restaurant magnet \""waterfront\"" opened in 2000 the parent company of The Rock Bottom Breweries decided to open Sing Sing in back of The Brewery.\n\nWhen it first opened it was pretty cool. The very first house band could put on a show that led to standing ovations. I know, I was there. From Stairway to Heaven to Free Bird, Stayin' Alive to She's My Cherry Pie, Elton John to the Boss, they were amazing at sounding like the bands they were covering. Equally incredible were the obscure songs that audience members would shout out, songs only you though you knew, and they would effortlessly sing a good portion of the song, sounding like the band who's song they sung.\n\nBut today, Sing Sing seems like it's stuck in the early part of the 21st century.

Went back in August on a Friday and asked if we could sit outside at one of the tables in front,  bartender told us yeah but we would have to come inside to order things because it's too busy. There were nine people in the bar section. It was nice out so we sat out there anyway. When our food was ready she knocked on the window and I had to go in to the bar and bring our food out to the table,  so it's got a nice authentic touch of waiting your own table yet paying someone else to do it. Eventually realized that she was doing this because she was screwing a waitress out of the table and didn't want to be seen. Classy. \n\nSame one was working the last time we went,  it was dead and she still couldn't keep up. Everything she said to anyone was prefaced with \""give me a second I have to get this for these people first\""  and then she would look at her phone. I mean I don't expect the best service on a Friday night somewhere but when it's dead and you can't even come close to keeping up what the hell are you doing. \n\nOn the bright side we got bread with our meal for the first time in the last four visits this time so....  progress I guess. The food really is great especially the mafalda but man the service has gotten to where it isn't worth it.",0,0,Negative,0,Negative
"I'll have a biased opinion of any place like this. What could be wrong with playing old and new school games, drinking, and eating all at the same place? The one thing I can think of is the price. On the surface, this is a pretty expensive place; however, they give a bunch of good deals depending on the time you go, whether or not you \""donate\"" money to the Make-a-Wish Foundation, and if you're lucky when you take a spin on the wheel of prizes! But honestly, know what the deals are before you go to make sure to get the best price available. \nIn regards to the games, there's a plethora for your enjoyment. Although it is nice to play games that spit out tickets, the last couple of times I've gone I've gotten 2 hours of arcade games for a very cheap price (Mario Kart, anyone?!). Either way, it's a really fun place that you'll most certainly have a good time at.",2,0,Negative,2,Positive
"This is a very small Irish pub.  The set up is relatively nice, despite its small size.

"It's hard to beat the atmosphere of this place in the summer. It's outdoor dining is right on the river, hovering above Washington's Landing Marina. However, the service is seriously lacking. With my parent's boat docked right below Redfin's, we frequently dine here before headed out on the water. The service has always been very slow. I understand that on a typical Friday or Saturday night it can get rather busy, but they should anticipate the crowd and be able to plan accordingly to accommodate! Luckily, the view is so nice that most of the time we're left waiting....and waiting....and waiting....it isn't too big of a deal because we're enjoying the outdoor space. \n\nThe food is average. Nothing I've had there was to die for, but on the same token, nothing was awful either. I'd only suggest this place to marina-goers or those looking for a nice outdoor dining space. Oh, and only come if you have lots of time!",0,0,Negative,0,Negative
"The vet met with us for a very short amount of time. She was rushed, seemed distracted, and was abrupt. She very quickly said that it seemed like SCC, or oral cancer, and that there was no cure and the prognosis wasn't good. She left the room seconds after and only came back in to say that they would get blood work and schedule a biopsy. After she said she thought it was SCC, she didn't give us a chance to ask questions or respond. \n\nThe technician didn't have any demeanor with our cat, nor with us as clients. She seemed tired, and overworked.\n\nAll in all, this was a negative experience. I recommend that you take your pets to another vet :(",0,0,Negative,0,Negative
"I was immediately displeased by the snaggle toothed hostess and her surly demeanor. The air conditioning was non existent, which is a hangover nightmare. While waiting for a table the bartender ignored us for ten minutes and couldn't even transfer our drinks to the table. He also casually instructed me that one must pay per beer - duh! I'm not a beer drinking novice. The acne-ridden server was friendly enough, but seemed forlorn and was overtly sweating. Bringing drinks to a table isn't neuroscience and I don't drink tap water. After sitting at our table for a few minutes it was very apparent that the entire serving staff is haggard. Appetizer - crab artichoke dip. Bland. Where's the crab? Also, did a toddler arrange the plate? Apparently. Meal - fish tacos. Came quickly and surprisingly flavorful. However, our server never once checked on our status and we had to beckon him to fulfill our needs. I shouldn't have to ask for napkins at the point of need. No tip, never coming back.",0,0,Negative,0,Negative
"We love eating at Christos and have many times in the past............however, I can't help feeling taken advantage of this summer on more than one occasion.  We love the simpleness of the place -- in fact it reminds me of Nana's kitchen growing up - NO frills - lots of love and yummy things to eat.\n\nThere is a particular st lye that I do not enjoy and that is the constant offers of this and that and they make it look like hummus and pita are complimentary as well as salads being included.  By the time one receives the bill -- EEKE! I could have eaten at a more upscale place.\n\nThat's all I have to say -- don't enjoy feeling hustled -- not sure if we will continue to dine there when there is a place right across the street with less charm but yummy food.",1,2,Positive,0,Negative
My Merlot was decent but the calamari was not. The calamari while had hints of Italian seasoning was bland and became soggy of the cooked vegetables that they had underneath it.

"This is a bizarre CVS, the kind you would only want to go to in a pinch, and maybe not even then.\n\nI went to this one with my husband a couple of times to pick up prescriptions, and the vibe from start to finish is so weird. Let's start with parking, which is in a lot behind the store. There's not a lot of visibility to the lot since it is on the back side of the CVS. Being that it is a pharmacy, there wouldn't be a back door or windows, so the lot has a feeling of dangerous seclusion.\n\nInside the store, everything I saw told me that \""this is a pharmacy that is in a rough neighborhood\"": shelves are only about 4'6\"" tall (presumably so workers can see what people are doing in the aisles); bizarre things are locked in cabinets with clear covers (regular brands of shampoo?!); beauty items regularly updated, weren't (I, er, have a nail polish problem; some of the products were about 4 seasons behind and quite a few polishes were separated); it feels like there isn't enough room for the products, which are disorganized and crammed onto shelves (reference the odd shelf height limitation).\n\nIf you can spare the gas and time, there is another a CVS on Center Ave within a mile or so or a Walgreen's (Penn Circ S+Trade St.) and a Rite Aid (Baum+Negley) within 1/2 mile.",0,0,Negative,0,Negative

"Good food and large portions. I ordered the Veggie Burger for $8.50 and I loved it! It's one of the most unique veggie burgers I have ever had: a homemade patty of beans, rolled oats and veggies. The chipotle mayo really gave it that oomph. My burger was more than enough for me to handle and everything was worth the price. As for drinks, I'm a complete noob when it comes to beer but my friend ordered a tap and even from a small taste, I could tell it was very good quality beer. Bitter and sweet, with a slight tang. I rarely drink beer but i I'm going to, then might as well drink the best kind there is - fresh and microbrewed.\n\nNOTE: There aren't too many options for vegetarians. The veggie burger was pretty good and I'd recommend it, but other than that, there's also the veggie tacos, a few select appetizers, and a few salads from which to choose.",2,2,Positive,2,Positive
"I have been coming to Gab n Eat for almost 20 years and They have never let me down. I get a typical breakfast if eggs, ham, toast, and home fries. Delicious as usual. The ambience however is usually lacking. The walls are dark, with writing and signatures of semi famous people all over the place. Pictures of local people hang on the walls(i secretly want mine up there) along with posters galore. While its fun to look at the first 10 times, it gets a little boring after awhile. So today when I arrived I expected the same old experience. Wow was I wrong! As soon as I looked at the door I knew something was different. The place seemed lighter and brighter. To my pleasant surprise, they painted and got new counter tops!! They're not quite done yet but the place has a new Happy vibe to it. The awesome breakfast, the new decor and the 5 guys sitting at the counter making me laugh are why I will be back( maybe for lunch).",2,1,Neutral,2,Positive
"Visited with a party of 8 last weekend for a friend's birthday. We walked in the door and could see no apparent host stand, so we tried the door next to the one we entered. This ended up leading to a private party. Can you say awkward?\n\nWe went back in the main door, clearly confused. The bartender looked at us but kept pouring drinks (rude!). Not even sure how we discovered it, but the host stand was in the BACK of the restaurant. How were we supposed to know this? We were seated, and had to wait awhile for service.\n\nFinally, the server came and took our drink orders and suggested a very strong drink for me. He was obviously trying to get me drunk (and succeeded). Caution: The Vesper is a strong *ss gin martini that is just okay. You pay 11 bucks to drink a shot of gin slowly from a fancy glass. \n\nHe then took our order...and did not think to write any of the 8 requests down. Yep, you guessed it. He screwed up our orders and bills, then proceeded to be rude about the situation. \n\nThe buffalo chicken dip is awesome, but be prepared, there is no chicken. We had one chunk in the two orders. The deep fried pita chips taste like donuts and are muy excellente. \n\nAlso, prepare yourself for bartenders squeezing caramel into glasses. The sound is reminiscent of flatulence. Over and over. So much flatulence. \n\nI was too drunk and full of pita donuts to eat my dinner. The two bites of my pork belly sandwich were pretty alright though.\n\nJesse from Bob Evans down the road is far superior to the condescending server here.

"This review is for Amtrak's \""Pennsylvanian\"" train, only, not for the system as a whole.\n\nO' Amtrak's \""Pennsylvanian\"" train.

"My friend and I were trying to think of a place to go last night for dinner before Mannheim Steamroller and she suggested Tambellini's. I hadn't been there for a million years and am not too thrilled with the downtown restaurant scene so I agreed. It all started when we were seated by the lack luster hostess. You could tell she either just didn't want to be at work yesterday or really hated her job. She had zero personality. Then we look at the menu. How much do you think they charge for simple bow tie pasta and meat sauce? You're probably thinking $10 or $12, right? WRONG! $20!! I was not happy about the ridiculous pricing, but my friend and I felt we were already sitting down and felt funny about leaving so we unfortunately stayed. Now I really wish we would have. I figured if I am going to spend $20 on simple pasta I'll spend $10 more and have a steak with it. I'm on an extremely strict diet of only 1200 calories a day so I could not have the bow ties with alfredo. All I asked for was for them to replace the alfredo with simple marinara. You would think I asked them to get Giada DeLaurentis to come and cook my pasta. The waitress gave me such an attitude and then punished us the rest of the time by ignoring us. After all that I get my meal, the steak is very good (even though it clearly was not well done, some of the pieces were practically still mooing) and the pasta was tasteless. I would have been furious if I paid $20 for tasteless pasta. Never again will I go there. That place is the worst and I recommend you guys don't waste your time or more importantly your money either. The staff needs an attitude adjustment, the prices need to be more reasonable given the global economic collapse and they need to work on creating more flavorful dishes.  The only reason I gave it a 2 is because the steak was good. Otherwise, it would have been a .5 or 1.",0,0,Negative,0,Negative

"Honestly, this the last place you'd ever expect to see me. First it's a vegan/veggie cafe, I am a complete carnivore. Secondly, it's like hipster brunch paradise, I'm super preppy (a heavily tattoed preppy person but still).  Yet this was one of the only places open on Labor Day and I walked in with my vegan friend, she immediately recognized her people and practically jizzed in her pants over the menu. OMG seitan gravy and cheez?\n\nWTF is seitan gravy and cheez? Why does she keep calling vegan cheese, \""cheez\"" anyway? I decided to go with the flow and order the Home Fries Ranchero. Basically their \""famous\"" home fries, chili, sour cream, eggs or tofu and cheez. I went native and ordered tofu vs eggs, and you know what? I liked it. It came out in a big heaping pile on a 70s retro plastic plate, accompanied with some awesome coffee. My friend had hummus and pita, cause not only is she vegan she only eats things in the white/beige color range (food racist).\n\nOne bad thing, the bathroom has no door, only the stall does. Basically it's a unisex bathroom where all the delightful sounds and smells can be experienced by diners directly in front of you. For a place that serves chili and \""cheez\"" they may want to reconsider this open approach.\n\nThere are some previous reviews about arrogant hipsters/bad service etc. I have say our waitress was awesome and attentive. My coffee was filled routinely, she understood that requesting a \""buttload\"" of cream meant a larger carafe of cream rather than a thimble. The host was apologetic for making us wait for more than a few minutes to sit down.I do admit it does have the indie coffee house feel, and yes hipsters abound here, but I have a feeling these are some legit hipsters. Not the trust fund having, whiny, I drink PBR, and annoy people with my smugness style hipster.  I bet these hipsters been squezzing their junk into tight pants long before I was born.

This place was adorable. Very nice inside. Solid wood bar long L-shaped with chairs. They also had tables & chairs set up in the back half of the place for table seating. My co-worker and I sat at the bar close to the door and had a few drinks. They served food but we weren't offered a menu  (hence the 3 stars). The bartender wasn't very friendly-later I realize that was just her personality. Still not so cute! They have really good martinis. We had a s'mores which was awesome and came with a chocolate covered marshmallow. We also got a prickly pear. Mmmmmmmm is all I have to say. If I'm ever in Pitts again I would go back cause I know the drinks are very good!\nP. S. They also had an upstairs not sure what was going on up there.

"D&B is nice once in a while but the food is insanely unhealthy. They are also really clever about designing the psychological context in ways to extract money from their customers. You feel a bit milked afterwards. Also much fatter.\n\nYou pay for games using credits from mag-stripe cards. This lets D&B give their games arbitrary prices and makes it harder for you to really know how much you are spending. Menus for drinks and food have no prices. $6.05 for a Banana Split cocktail? $3.40 for a Michelob?  I have no idea whether that is expensive but not showing the prices is clever because they can price their things and not have to obey pricing psychology (like anchors and so forth).\n\nWaitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts. Oh, and the dining room has plastic demos dessert trays to get that thought going in your mind as you walk to your table.\n\nThe games are all violent shooters or racing games don't appear to have changed much since 2002 when I last went to D&B in California. Hope they can find more innovative arcade games in the future.\n\nNot a pleasant experience, but at least it's different from going to an ordinary restaurant.",0,0,Negative,0,Negative
"Yes, Max & Erma's is a chain, but not all are created equal.  The Max & Erma's at 630 Stanwix Street in downtown Pittsburgh is a great place for a casual meal.  They have very good food and service.  If you hit there during rush hour skip the waiting list and go to the bar for faster service. They have great burgers, but I like the choice of a half sandwich and soup or salad.  I also like the frequent diner program, which gives you a 5% discount after eating there about 5 times and a larger discount the more often you eat there.  They also send you specials via e-mail from time to time.  On Wednesdays they give you two free chocolate chip cookies with your meal. On your birthday month they give you six free chocolate chip cookies.  The cookies are usually served hot, right from the kitchen and are delicious. Max & Erma's also has a great bar.  This location is just across the river from PNC Park and Heinz Field.  You can grab the T about 1/2 block from Max & Erma's and get off at the North Shore stop, which is between the two stadiums.

"After a long enduring 12 plus hour trip to Pittsburgh, my shuttle driver told me about the delivery service at Vincent's and suggested their food was worth checking out. Overwhelmed with work at that time of the night and unfamiliarity with the area prompted a quick call for their Ad's Rockin' Pasta ($17). I was initially told the delivery would arrive in 45 minutes to an hour, but the food came knocking on my hotel room sooner than expected. \n\nThe complimentary mini garlic buns were cooled by that time. It was over-buttered but yummy nonetheless. It was a delight to see the whopping serving of pasta after not having anything to eat all day. Thankfully it was kept warm by the plastic container and comforting with every bite. The generous servings of angel hair was filled to the brim with juicy chicken slices, very few shrimps, mushrooms, roasted and hot peppers drenched in a mild marinara sauce. The flood of sweet and semi-savory marinara was not the ideal and the peppers also did not make an impression. The quality of the pasta was overcooked and oversoaked, but the pieces of chunky chicken were tender and delicious. The side salad did not look very fresh and was not newsworthy.\n\nI didn't get a chance to visit the venue to get a better impression of the establishment, but as a delivery service I thought it was fast while portions were very generous. Value wise, kudos to them for having a $5 children's menu for those at the ages 2-10.

"Stopped in last night because we wanted to 'step out' of our usual places on Carson St.  The place was rather busy and was pleasantly warm on a cold Saturday night.  We found seats at the bar and a friendly bartender greeted us and took our drink order.  The drafts arrived right away and we requested menu's...  \n\nWe ordered 2 shrimp cocktails and a calamari.  The shrimp arrived within 5 minutes and came with a small bowl of cocktail sauce with a dollop of horseradish on top.  I mixed mine as I love horseradish but my friend would have preferred it on the side or in another bowl as he isn't a fan.  The shrimp were big and fresh and delicious.  I mean- can you really mess up cold shrimp...?  The calamari took over a half hour to arrive.  It was pleasing to the eye and smelled delicious.  It had grilled onions & peppers on it with a slight spice dusted on top.  I thought it was delicious but my wife wasn't digging it.  She thought it was overcooked & rubbery.  Our friend isn't a fan of calamari so we didn't have a 3rd opinion to be the deciding factor...\n\nThen things went south...\nMy wife went into the ladies room and came out with a straight up disgusted look on her face.  I saw her stop a waitress and after the 'chat' the waitress turned away and rolled her eyes.  Well, my wife said the bathroom was disgusting- Toilet paper & paper towels all over the floor, 5 stalls with only a half roll of toilet paper to be shared between all 5, no paper towels to dry your hands off after you washed them.  Does the employees have a separate washroom to use or do they use this one also and just don't notice???  The health dept signs say \""Employees must wash & dry hands with soap & hot water\"".  Then I visited the Men's room and found almost the same thing- paper all over the floor in the stalls, I didn't notice if they had tp in there, and no paper towels to dry your hands with.  \n\nTo us- the bathrooms must be clean & well stocked or we wonder what the kitchen & other 'back of house' areas look like.  If the bathrooms are in this much need of attention- the kitchen must be worse...  \n\nWe paid our tab and left...",1,1,Neutral,0,Negative
"You know what you're getting with a Steak N Shake: it's about one rung up from a McD's in quality, and about two rungs down in quickness. At least, you think you know. \n\nI used to have a small place in my heart (though the salt and fat weren't very kind to said organ) for Steak N Shake, because hey, who can argue with beef and drinkable ice cream? But after my last trip, I can think of nothing more disgusting than having to eat here, this location in particular. I haven't been back in over year, and I will never step foot into a Steak N Shake as long as I have an immune system that I care about. \n\nAfter having eaten here, I hit the restroom on my way out (along with my two friends....hey, we're girls, it's acceptable!). One stall was already taken, so two of us are stuck waiting while this occupant does her....shall we say, business? After a few seconds, we realize that she's not only there to relieve herself, but to also take drive-through orders. Yes, that's right....\""You want fries with that? *flush* Okay, that will be $5.50\"". I have never, ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom. To top it off, after finishing her \""bathroom break\"", she walks straight out of the stall and into the restaurant. I guess she was in too much of a rush to complete the order she had just taken that she didn't have time to wash her hands. And I was in too much of a rush to choke back up what I had just eaten before it wreaked mayhem on my stomach.",0,0,Negative,0,Negative

"I always feel like I am constantly bashing breweries for their food, but in my opinion, I feel the bar is raised for places like this. It seems there are so many breweries out there that offer great beer, and slack off on the food. Unfortunately Rock Bottom is one that falls into that category. Let's be honest, when you go to a brewery, you want the full experience. If it was only about the beer, I'd go buy a growler and take it home. \n\nSo, about the beer....EXCELLENT!!!!! The Jagoff IPA is with out a doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had! They only I can think of that I think is better is Dogfish Head, but that's a matter of opinion. The beer selection is constantly changing, and they always have some excellent seasonal beers. You can't go wrong, there's bound to be a beer everyone will like. \n\nAs for the food.......it's pretty much a crap shoot. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible. My biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food. One time it's perfect, then maybe it's cold, or it's burned, or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it. Unfortunately, it seems there is zero attention to food quality. \n\nThat's pretty much it. This place fixes it's food consistency, and it's a five star place.

At one hour and 45 minutes complained to the manager that we still had not received out entrees.  He said 'What do you want me to do about it?\"" and said they had a busy night.

"I have been in Brookline for a year and consider this to be one of the jewels of the neighborhood.\nI visited in May 2014 for dinner with a friend.  He had veal parm.  It came stand alone and the pasta on the side at cost.  I had the old tried and true spaghetti and meatballs.\n\nThe veal was excellent.  Breaded ever so lightly, fried gently. Very flavorful.  The meatballs, delicious.  The spaghetti sauce, sweet and incredibly flavorful.  We both had the wedding soup, and my only regret was that I didn't order a bowl.  Broth, escarole, carrot, meat....a classic done superbly well.\n\nWe each had an alcohol drink, one wine, one beer.\nBill came to about $15 for the both.  \n\nGreat food and at an affordable price.

"I think the only thing I appreciate about Whole Foods is entering the store and seeing their fresh cut flowers.  Let's see why.....\n\nI attempt to drive to Whole Foods only to be caught in a line of 5-6 cars attempting to get into the parking lot.  (I guess I'm not cool enough to ride Pat Transit from the South Pittsburgh home).  When I find a place to park, after the Lexus SUV (HA!) pulls out, I find that they didn't put their cart back.  \n\nSo I enter the store and admire how their design is very appealing to the eyes (how DO organic oranges get so ROUND and so ORANGE) and everything is stacked so neatly.  Then I read that a pound of these oranges are $1.99...  Then I go to the meat section, which I don't even eat, to find that the prices are double those of Trader Joe's or even Market District (see future review).  So I walk around and debate to see if I should buy Clif Bars and Naked Juice (which happens to be on sale) because LORD KNOWS I don't need bulk-blanched-almonds.  But then I decide to buy \""fresh\"" CHUNKY peanut butter because it would be fun to try.  (When I get home later, however, I bought Valencia peanut butter, whatever the hell that is, and cannot stomach it.  Gimmie my Jif.)

So I moved to Pittsburgh from Los Angeles. I know I know I know!\nAnyway so theres absolutely no places in Homestead that delivered Chinese so I decided to walk down to the closest Chinese food/restaurant to my house. \n\nThe family that runs the restaurant is very friendly. I read a review about them on Google that said the  mom looks like she might want to cook you alive. Don't believe it!\n\nOn this visit I ordered the Steamed Dumplings(recommended by some reviewer on google...THAT LIAR) and the Vegetable Chow Fun. I generally enjoy steamed dumplings but these dumplings(too much dumpling little meat) werent so good. Theyll probably be sitting in my mini fridge tomorrow and I'll force myself to eat them when I have the munchies/starving to death. The Vegetable Chow Fun on the other hand verrrrrrrrrrrrrry yummy.

"I'd like to echo the advice of another commenter: do not pre-pay.\n\nI dropped off a pair of boots for salt removal, new heels, and a polish. I was very specific about the polish, because I wanted them to look nice. When I picked up my boots, I noticed that they looked very dull and there was still clumps of wax on them. When I pointed this out to the clerk, she took them back to the gentleman in the back (the owner, I think). He said that the wax hadn't been buffed off. He gave them a quick polish and took $5.00 off the price. If he had then returned the boots to me freshly polished and shiny, that would have been the end of it. The problem was he gave them a  half-assed shine. After sitting for 3+ days with dried wax on them, a quick polish didn't remove much the dullness.  When I pointed this out to the gentleman, he said he had done the best he could. Quite frankly,  If that's the best he can do, he shouldn't be in shoe repair.\n\n I finally just gave up trying to make him understand why I was unhappy, because it was clear he wasn't going to help me, and he was becoming rude and unprofessional. I had made the mistake of prepaying. He had my money and had no more use for me. I think if I had owed him money, he would have taken my concerns more seriously, instead of becoming increasingly snarky and mean. \n\nI wish that I had paid closer attention to the other negative review about Ullirch's on Yelp (which also includes pictures) because it closely mirrors my own experience, both in terms of workmanship and customer service. The gentleman who owns the shop is sugar and spice when he's taking your money if you foolishly prepay, but quite unpleasant if you dare to complain about shoddy work. Personally, I don't mind if people make a mistake as long as they own up to it and correct it. It's when you're abusive about your own error that I take offense.\n\nIf you do chose Ullirch's, do NOT prepay.",0,0,Negative,0,Negative
"Decided to hit this place before hitting on 12 while the dealer shows a 9 at the Rivers.   We didn't have a reservation but the server seated us anyways (we had to be done by 7).  It is BYOB but they deal you a $4 corkage fee per person drinking.  The bread sticks were fresh and warm and were the perfect accompaniment to the delicious soup du jour, potato soup.  The side salad that comes with the meal would make the hall of fame for any side salad league.  It came with olives, Gorgonzola, julienned carrots and other veggies.  I had the pork tenderloin with veggies and mashed potatoes.   The tenderloin was perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes were like having two aces in the hole.   It would be tough to find a better waitstaff.   Plates disappeared, water was filled, and I never knew they were there.  If your looking for a place to try before going to the casino or bucco game this is a sure bet, just call ahead for reservations.

"Incredibly authentic Italian cuisine. If your looking for a memorable spot with some of the most delicious actually Italian dishes then look no further than Alla Famiglia. This is a restaurant to celebrate an occasion at such as New Years, Valentines Day, Anniversaries,etc. \nmy girlfriend and I came here for New Year's Eve and we could not have enjoyed it more. To start we had the Alla Famiglia Meatball. I couldn't get over the rich tomato sauce that the meatball was surrounded in and the smoothness of the actual meat. Just delicious, must have.\nWhen you order an entree you also get their house salad served in a homemade Italian vinaigrette (light and complimenting to the diverse salad topped with great peppers!) and their Penne Alla Vodka. This pasta dish alone is enough to warrant a visit . I am a alla vodka lover and this is the best I've ever had. It's hard to describe but its not to rich or creamy it's absolutely just right. The pasta itself was so smooth and melted in your mouth with their sauce.\n\nFor entree my girlfriend had their Ahi Tuna Steak (special). Prepared perfectly and with a great lemon butter sauce. I had their speciality, their double cut Veal Chop. This is something straight out of The Flintstones in its portion but let me tell you it's with every penny. I had the Veal Chop Pizzoaloa style wivh was with hot & sweet peppers, a great tomato sauce covered in provolone cheese. This was such a moist Veal Chop that literally fell off the bone and with the marbling it just melted in your mouth. \nEverything was spectacular , it's a restaurant you have to visit if your in the area at least once given you are willing to spend for your meal. $$$$ but you absolutely get what you pay for.",2,2,Positive,2,Positive
"Ladies and Gentleman, welcome to pancake heaven. It was several years ago that I first came upon The Dor-Stop, and since then my breakfast lifestyle has been forever changed.\n\nI know this will sound like blasphemy coming from a Dor-Stop convert, but I hate pancakes. I just don't understand them, they are odd and moist, and nowhere near as delicious as waffles. I came into The Dor-Stop the first time with this mindset, and am now forever changed. \n\nThe Dor-Stop's hotcakes are delicious and almost cake-like. They aren't thin crepes, or undercooked globs of batter, but instead sweet, fluffy treats that come in a plethora of flavors. I personally endorse oatmeal walnut, but others love the banana or pumpkin (when in season). I recommend ordering the \""Egg Combo\"": 2 hot cakes, eggs, and bacon/sausage. Go all out, you deserve it. \n\nOn a recent visit, I also discovered the french toast menu, which has caused me to forsake my hot cake habit. The french toast is almost deep fried and covered in this raspberry yogurt. It is a can't miss item on the menu, rivaling that of the hot cake. When pumpkin french toast is a special on the menu, I suggest you run to The Dor-Stop and taste a little of heaven. \n\nI've also sampled various items from the lunch menu with no complaints. The Rachel and Ruben are especially tasty if you feel like bypassing the breakfast menu. \n\nThis place is truly heaven in Dor-Stop.

"Sadly I've been here a few times because it's a crowd pleaser when my girlfriend's parents come down to visit. There's nothing really WRONG with it. The portions are big and the food is \""alright\"" and the interior gives you the superficial impression that you're encountering fine dining.\n\nThe food is sooooo bland though. Everything you get at P.F. Chang's you can get elsewhere in Pittsburgh at a much lower cost and it'll be made with more precision and have better flavor. The honey chicken at P.F. Chang's was so mediocre all I could think about while eating it was heading over to Wai Wai in Bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks.\n\nLast time we were there the server was horrendous as well. I don't think I've ever felt as awkward at a restaurant. He brought my girlfriend's father (Don) his unsweetened tea then told him he didn't bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself. He then got all huffy when Don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. When he came back to take our order Don ordered for himself and his wife and before Janey (my girlfriend) and I could order he had already started to walk away. We actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. (not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) After that he must have thought we were terrible diners (I don't think I've ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or ANYONE for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died.\n\nObviously the attitude of one idiot who can't hide his bad day well doesn't really have anything to do with the restaurant. But it's soooooo bland! Go somewhere else for Chinese! Look up Chinese on Urbanspoon and it'll give you a variety of good, local places to choose from at half the price.",0,1,Neutral,0,Negative
